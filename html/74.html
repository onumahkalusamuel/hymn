1. There came from the skies
In the days long ago
The Lord with a message of love;
The world knew Him not;
He was treated with scorn
This wonderful gift from above
</p><p class="chorus">
They crowned Him with thorns
He was beaten with stripes
He was smitten and nailed to the tree
But the pain in His heart
Was the hardest to bear
The heart that was broken for me...
</p><p class="stanza">
2. He came to His own -
To the ones that He loved;
The sheep that had wandered astray;
They heard not His voice,
But the Friend of mankind
Was hated and driven away
</p><p class="chorus">
They crowned Him with thorns
He was beaten with stripes
He was smitten and nailed to the tree
But the pain in His heart
Was the hardest to bear
The heart that was broken for me...
</p><p class="stanza">
3. The birds have their nests, 
and the foxes have holes, 
But He had no place for His head;
A pallet of stone on the cold mountain side
Was all that He had for His bed.
</p><p class="chorus">
They crowned Him with thorns
He was beaten with stripes
He was smitten and nailed to the tree
But the pain in His heart
Was the hardest to bear
The heart that was broken for me...
</p><p class="stanza">
4. I cannot reject such a Saviour as he;
Dishonour and wound Him again;
I'll go to His feet and repent of my sin,
Be willing to suffer the pain.
</p><p class="chorus">
They crowned Him with thorns
He was beaten with stripes
He was smitten and nailed to the tree
But the pain in His heart
Was the hardest to bear
The heart that was broken for me...
