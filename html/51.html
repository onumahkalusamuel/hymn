1. There's a blessed land that we call Canaan,
Land of promise, land of victory,
Where the Spirit's given without measure,
where the soul from self has been set free.

It is wonderful to live in Canaan,
Where the milk and honey flow,
Where the land is bearing in abundance
And the grapes of Eschol grow.
It is  wonderful to live in Canaan,
Just a lovely place to dwell.

life is grand,
In that blessed Canaan land?

All his fullness as he takes control,
Blessed fullness of the Holy Spirit;
O what glory he brings to the soul!

Have you left the wilderness behind
And received the Spirit in His full-ness?
If you haven't then  make up  your mind.
