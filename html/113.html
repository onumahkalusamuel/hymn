1. Go and tell the story to thy friends to-day,
How the Lord of glory met thee on thy way;
How He cleansed thy spir-it from the stain of sin,
Driving out the foes who reigned thy heart within.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Go and tell the story, tell it far and wide,
How the Lord of glory for the sinner died;
And the soul that hears it, and in faith believes,
Straightway he the cleansing from the Lord receives.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Go and tell the story, of His pow'r to save,
Of the sinful "legion" sunk beneath the wave;
Tell of His compassion, of His love so true,
Of the wondrous things the Lord hath done for you.
</p><p class="chorus">
Go and tell the story, tell it far and wide,
How the Lord of glory for the sinner died;
And the soul that hears it, and in faith believes,
Straightway he the cleansing from the Lord receives.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Go and tell the story, how he reigns above, 
Winning men to glory thro' His dying love;
How He waits to crown them kings forevermore,
In the home awaiting, on the other shore.
</p><p class="chorus">
Go and tell the story, tell it far and wide,
How the Lord of glory for the sinner died;
And the soul that hears it, and in faith believes,
Straightway he the cleansing from the Lord receives.
