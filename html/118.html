1. I love to tell the story of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and His glory, of Jesus and His love;
I love to tell the story because I know 'tis true,
It satisfies my longings as nothing else can do.
</p><p class="chorus">
I love to tell the story!
'Twill be my theme in glory-
To tell the old, old story
Of Jesus and his love.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. I love to tell the story - 'tis pleasant to repeat
What seems, each time I tell it, more wonderfully sweet;
I love to tell the story, for some have never heard
The message of salvation from God's own holy word.
</p><p class="chorus">
I love to tell the story!
'Twill be my theme in glory-
To tell the old, old story
Of Jesus and his love.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. I love to tell the story, for those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting to hear it like the rest;
And when in scenes of glory, I sing the new, new song, 
'Twill be the old, old story that I have love so long.
</p><p class="chorus">
I love to tell the story!
'Twill be my theme in glory-
To tell the old, old story
Of Jesus and his love.
