1. All hail the power of Jesus' name!  
Let angels prostrate fall; 
Bring forth the royal diadem, 
And crown him Lord of all.  
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Crown him, ye martyrs of your God, 
Who from his altar call; 
Extol the Stem of Jesse's Rod, 
And crown him Lord of all.  
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Ye chosen seed of Israel's race, 
ye ransomed from the fall, 
Hail him who saves you by his grace, 
And crown him Lord of all.

4. Ye Gentile sinners, ne'er forget 
The wormwood and the gall;
Go spread your trophies at his feet, 
And crown him Lord of all.  
</p><p class="stanza">
5. Let every kindred, every tribe 
On this terrestrial ball, 
To him all majesty ascribe, 
And crown him Lord of all.  
</p><p class="stanza">
6. O that with yonder sacred throng 
We at his feet may fall,  
We'll join the everlasting song, 
And crown him Lord of all.
