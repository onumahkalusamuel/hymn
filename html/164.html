1. Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,
Unuttered or expressed;
The motion of a hidden fire
That trembles in the breast.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
The falling of a tear
The upward glancing of an eye,
When none but God is near.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Prayer is the simplest form of speech
That infant lips can try;
Prayer, the sublimest strains that reach
The Majesty on high.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice,
Returning from his ways,
While angels in their songs rejoice,
And cry; Behold, he prays!
</p><p class="stanza">
5. Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,
The Christian's native air,
His watchword at the gates of death;
He enters heaven with prayer.
</p><p class="stanza">
6. O Thou by Whom we come to God,
The Life, the Truth, the Way!
The path of prayer Thyself hast trod:
Lord, teach us how to pray.
