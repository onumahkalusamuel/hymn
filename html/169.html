1. What a Friend we have in Jesus, 
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry 
Ev'rything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit, 
O what needless pain we bear-
All because we do not carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer. 
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Have we trials and temptations? 
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful 
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Are we weak and heavy laden, 
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour, still our refuge,-
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee? 
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
You will find a solace there.
