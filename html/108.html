1. "Must I go, and empty-handed,"
Thus my dear Redeemer meet?
Not one day of service give Him,
Lay no trophy at His feet?
</p><p class="chorus">
"Must I go, and empty handed?"
Must I meet my Saviour so?
Not one soul with which to greet Him:
Must I empty handed go?
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Not at death I shrink or falter,
For my Saviour saves me now;
But to meet Him empty-handed,
Thought of that now clouds my brow.
</p><p class="chorus">
"Must I go, and empty handed?"
Must I meet my Saviour so?
Not one soul with which to greet Him:
Must I empty handed go?
</p><p class="stanza">
3. O the years in sinning wasted,
Could I but recall them now,
I would give them to my Saviour,
To His will I'd gladly bow.
</p><p class="chorus">
"Must I go, and empty handed?"
Must I meet my Saviour so?
Not one soul with which to greet Him:
Must I empty handed go?
</p><p class="stanza">
4. O ye saints, arouse, be earnest,
Up and work while yet 'tis day;
Ere the night of death o'er take thee,
Strive for souls while still you may.
</p><p class="chorus">
"Must I go, and empty handed?"
Must I meet my Saviour so?
Not one soul with which to greet Him:
Must I empty handed go?
