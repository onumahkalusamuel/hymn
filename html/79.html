1. I must needs go home by the way of the cross,
There's no other way but this;
I shall ne'er get sight of the Gates of Light,
If the way of the cross I miss.
</p><p class="chorus">
The way of the cross leads home,
The way of the cross leads home,
It is sweet to know, as I onward go,
The way of the cross leads home.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. I must needs go on in the blood-sprinkled way,
The path that the Saviour trod;
If I ever climb to the heights sublime,
Where the soul is at home with God.
</p><p class="chorus">
The way of the cross leads home,
The way of the cross leads home,
It is sweet to know, as I onward go,
The way of the cross leads home.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Then I bid farewell to the way of the world,
To walk in it never more;
For my Lord says, "Come!", and I seek my home,
Where He waits at the open door.
</p><p class="chorus">
The way of the cross leads home,
The way of the cross leads home,
It is sweet to know, as I onward go,
The way of the cross leads home.
