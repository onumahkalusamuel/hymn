1. A good High Priest is come,
Supplying Aaron's place,
And taking up his room,
Dispensing life and grace,
The law by Aaron's priesthood came,
But grace and truth by Jesus' name.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. He once temptations knew
Of every sort and kind,
That He might succour show
To every tempted mind:
In every point the Lamb was tried
Like us, and then for us He died.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. He died, but lives again,
And by the throne He stands,
There shows how, He was slain;
Opening His pierced hands:
Our Priest abides and pleads the cause
Of us who have transgressed His laws.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. I other priests disclaim,
And laws and offerings too;
None but the bleeding Lamb
The mighty work can do;
He shall have all the praise, for He
Hath loved and lived and died for me.
