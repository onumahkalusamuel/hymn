1. Have you any room for Jesus,
He who bore your load of sin?
As He knocks and asks admission,
Sinners, will you let Him in?
</p><p class="chorus">
Room for Jesus, King of Glory,
Hasten now, His Word obey;
Swing the heart's door widely open,
Bid Him enter while you may.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Room for pleasure, room for business,
But for Christ the Crucified;
Not a place that He can enter,
In your heart for which He died?
</p><p class="chorus">
Room for Jesus, King of Glory,
Hasten now, His Word obey;
Swing the heart's door widely open,
Bid Him enter while you may.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Have you any room for Jesus,
As in grace He calls again?
O today is time accepted,
Tomorrow you may call in vain.
</p><p class="chorus">
Room for Jesus, King of Glory,
Hasten now, His Word obey;
Swing the heart's door widely open,
Bid Him enter while you may.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Room and time now give to Jesus,
Soon will pass God's day of grace;
Soon thy heart left cold and silent,
And thy Saviour's pleading cease.
</p><p class="chorus">
Room for Jesus, King of Glory,
Hasten now, His Word obey;
Swing the heart's door widely open,
Bid Him enter while you may.
