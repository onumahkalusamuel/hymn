1. Another year is dawning, 
Dear Father, let it be
In working or in waiting, 
Another year with Thee.
Another year of progress, 
Another year of praise,
Another year of proving 
Thy presence all the days.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Another year of mercies, 
Of faithfulness and grace;
Another year of gladness 
In the shining of Thy face;
Another year of leaning
Upon Thy loving breast;
Another year of trusting, 
Of quiet, happy rest;
</p><p class="stanza">
3.	Another year of service,
Of witness for Thy love,
Another year of training
For holier work above.
Another year is dawning, 
Dear Father, let it be
On earth, or else in Heaven, 
Another year for Thee.
