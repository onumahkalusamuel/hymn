1. O Lord, "with one accord,"
We gather round Thy Throne, 
To hear Thy holy Word, 
To wordship Thee alone.
Now send from heaven the Holy Ghost, 
Be this another Pentecost!
</p><p class="stanza">
2. We have no strength to meet 
The storms that round us lower,
Keep Thou our trembling feet
In every trying hour;
More than victorious shall we be
If girded with Thy panoply.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Where is the mighty wind
That shook the holy place, 
That gladdened every mind, 
And brightened every face?
And where the cloven tongues of flame
That marked each follower of the Lamb?
</p><p class="stanza">
4. There is no change in Thee, 
Lord God the Holy Ghost, 
Thy glorious majesty 
Is as at Pentecost!
O may our loosened tongues proclaim, 
That Thou, our God, art still the same.
