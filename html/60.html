1. Living below, in this old sinful world
Hardly a comfort can afford;
Striving alone to face temptations sore,
Where could I go but to the Lord?
</p><p class="chorus">
Where could I go, O where could I go,
Seeking a refuge for my soul?
Needing a friend to help me in the end,
Where could I go but to the Lord?
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Neighbors are kind, I love them everyone
We get along in sweet accord;
But when my soul needs manna from above,
Where could I go but to the Lord?
</p><p class="chorus">
Where could I go, O where could I go,
Seeking a refuge for my soul?
Needing a friend to help me in the end,
Where could I go but to the Lord?
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Life here is grand with friends I love so dear,
Comfort I get from God's own word;
Yet when I face this chilling hand of death,
Where could I go but to the Lord?
</p><p class="chorus">
Where could I go, O where could I go,
Seeking a refuge for my soul?
Needing a friend to help me in the end,
Where could I go but to the Lord?
