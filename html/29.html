1. I don't know about tomorrow,
I just live from day to day;
I don't borrow from its sunshine
For its skies may turn to gray;
I don't worry o'er the future,
For I know what Jesus said,
And today I'll walk beside Him
For He knows what is ahead.
</p><p class="chorus">
Many things about tomorrow
I don't seem to understand
But I know who holds tomorrow
And I know who holds my hand
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Ev'ry step is getting brighter
As the golden stairs I climb;
Ev'ry burden's getting lighter,
Ev'ry cloud is silver-lined.
There the sun is always shining,
There no tear will dim the eye;
At the ending of the rainbow
Where the mountains touch the sky.
</p><p class="chorus">
Many things about tomorrow
I don't seem to understand
But I know who holds tomorrow
And I know who holds my hand
</p><p class="stanza">
3. I don't know about tomorrow,
It may bring me poverty;
But the one who feeds the sparrow 
Is the one who stands by me;
And the path that be my portion,
May be through the flame or flood,
But His presence goes before me,
And I'm covered with His blood.
</p><p class="chorus">
Many things about tomorrow
I don't seem to understand
But I know who holds tomorrow
And I know who holds my hand
