1. "Called unto holiness," church of our God,
Purchase of Jesus, redeemed by His blood;
Called from the world and its idols to flee,
Called from the bondage of sin to be free.
 </p><p class="chorus">
"Holiness unto the Lord" is our
  watchword and song,
"Holiness unto the Lord" as we're
  marching along:
Sing it, shout it, loud and long,
"Holiness unto the Lord," now and forever.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. "Called unto holiness," children of light,
Walking with Jesus in garments of white;
Raiment unsullied, nor tarnished with sin;
God's Holy Spirit abiding within.
 </p><p class="chorus">
"Holiness unto the Lord" is our
  watchword and song,
"Holiness unto the Lord" as we're
  marching along:
Sing it, shout it, loud and long,
"Holiness unto the Lord," now and forever.

3. "Called unto holiness," praise His dear name,
This blessed secret to faith now made plain,
Not our own righteousness, but Christ within,
Living, and reigning, and saving from sin.
 </p><p class="chorus">
"Holiness unto the Lord" is our
  watchword and song,
"Holiness unto the Lord" as we're
  marching along:
Sing it, shout it, loud and long,
"Holiness unto the Lord," now and forever.

4. "Called unto holiness," glorious thought!
Up from the wilderness wanderings brought,
Out from the shadows and darkness of night,
Into the Canaan of perfect delight.
 </p><p class="chorus">
"Holiness unto the Lord" is our
  watchword and song,
"Holiness unto the Lord" as we're
  marching along:
Sing it, shout it, loud and long,
"Holiness unto the Lord," now and forever.

5. "Called unto holiness," Bride of the Lamb,
Waiting the Bridegroom's returning again;
Lift up your heads, for the day draweth near.
When in His beauty the King shall appear.
 </p><p class="chorus">
"Holiness unto the Lord" is our
  watchword and song,
"Holiness unto the Lord" as we're
  marching along:
Sing it, shout it, loud and long,
"Holiness unto the Lord," now and forever.
