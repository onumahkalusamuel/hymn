1. Marvellous message we bring,
Glorious carol we sing,
Wonderful word of the King,
Jesus is coming again!....
 </p><p class="chorus">
Coming again, Coming again,
May be morning, may be noon,
May be evening and may be soon!
Coming again, Coming again;
O what a wonderful day it will be!
Jesus is coming again!

2. Forest and flower exclaim,
Mountain and meadow the same,
All earth and heaven proclaim,
Jesus is coming again!....
 </p><p class="chorus">
Coming again, Coming again,
May be morning, may be noon,
May be evening and may be soon!
Coming again, Coming again;
O what a wonderful day it will be!
Jesus is coming again!

3. Standing before Him at last,
Trial and trouble all past,
Crowns at His feet we will cast,
Jesus is coming again!.... 
 </p><p class="chorus">
Coming again, Coming again,
May be morning, may be noon,
May be evening and may be soon!
Coming again, Coming again;
O what a wonderful day it will be!
Jesus is coming again!
