1.Jesus, my Strength, my Hope,
On Thee I cast my care,
With humble confidence look up,
And know Thou hear'st my prayer.
Give me on Thee to wait,
Til I can all things do;
On Thee, Almighty to create,
Almighty to renew.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. I want a godly fear,
A quick discerning eye
That looks to Thee when sin is near
And sees the tempter fly:
A spirit still prepared
And armed with jealous care,
For ever standing on its guard
And watching unto prayer.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. I want a true regard,
A single, steady aim,
Unmoved by threatening or reward,
To Thee and Thy great name;
A jealous, just concern
For Thine immortal praise;
A pure desire that all may learn
And glorify Thy grace.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. I rest upon Thy Word;
The promise is for me;
My succour and salvation, 
Lord, shall surely come from Thee:
But let me still abide,
Nor from my hope remove,
Till Thou my patient spirit guide
Into Thy perfect love.
