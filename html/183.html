1. Come, O my God, the promise seal,
This mountain, sin, remove;
Now in my gasping soul reveal
The virtue of Thy love.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. I want thy life, thy purity,
Thy righteousness, brought in;
I ask, desire, and trust in thee,
To be redeemed from sin.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Anger and sloth, desire and pride,
This moment be subdued!
Be cast into the crimson tide
Of my Redeemer's blood!
</p><p class="stanza">
4.	Saviour, to thee my soul looks up,
My present Saviour Thou!
In all the confidence of hope,
I claim the blessing now.
</p><p class="stanza">
5. 'Tis done! thou does this moment,
With full salvation bless;
Redemption through thy blood I have,
Save and spotless love and peace.
