1. Sweet is the promise "I will not forget thee,"
Nothing can molest or turn my soul away;
E'en though the night be dark within the valley,
Just beyond is shining an eternal day.
 </p><p class="chorus">
I. . . will not forget thee or leave thee;
In My hands I'll hold thee,
In My arms I'll fold thee,
I. . . will not forget thee or leave thee;
I am thy Redeemer, I will care for thee.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. How can I show my gratitude to Jesus, 
For His love unfailing and His tender care?
I will proclaim to others His salvation,
That they may accept Him and His promise share.
</p><p class="chorus">
I. . . will not forget thee or leave thee;
In My hands I'll hold thee,
In My arms I'll fold thee,
I. . . will not forget thee or leave thee;
I am thy Redeemer, I will care for thee.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Trusting the promise "I will not forget thee,"
Onward I will go with songs of joy and praise;
Tho' earth despise me, tho' my friends forsake me,
Jesus will be near me gladdening my days.
</p><p class="chorus">
I. . . will not forget thee or leave thee;
In My hands I'll hold thee,
In My arms I'll fold thee,
I. . . will not forget thee or leave thee;
I am thy Redeemer, I will care for thee.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. When at the golden portals I am standing,
All my tribulations, all my sorrows past;
How sweet to hear the blessed proclamation,
"Enter, faithful servant, welcome home at last!"
</p><p class="chorus">
I. . . will not forget thee or leave thee;
In My hands I'll hold thee,
In My arms I'll fold thee,
I. . . will not forget thee or leave thee;
I am thy Redeemer, I will care for thee.
