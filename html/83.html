A light to my path alway;
To guide and to save me from sin,
And show me the heavenly way.

Established and fixed on high;
Thy faithfulness unto all men
Abideth forever nigh.

I ever will give Thee praise;
For Thou art my portion, O Lord,
And shall be through all my days!

The Saviour and Morning Star,
Salvation and peace have been bro't
To those who have strayed afar.

That I might not sin, that I might not sin,
