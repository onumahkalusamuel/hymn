1. Since the Saviour came to this heart of mine
My cup's filled and running over
Filling my poor soul with his joy divine
My cup's filled and running over.

Ru. . .nning over,
Ru. . .nning over,
My cups filled and running over
Since the lord saved me
I'm as happy as can be
My cup's filled and running over

2. With my Lord so Dear I have naught to fear
My cup's filled and running over,
Tho' my way be drear He is ever near
My cup's filled and running over

Ru. . .nning over,
My cups filled and running over
Since the lord saved me

My cup's filled and running over,
Christ my Lord shall be my comfort still,
My cup's filled and running over

4. Sinner seek the Lord, trust his precious word,
While the angels round you hover,
Heaven's bells will ring, and you then will sing,
My cup's fill'd and running over

Ru. . .nning over,
Ru. . .nning over,
My cups filled and running over
Since the lord saved me
I'm as happy as can be
