1. Does Jesus care when my heart is pained
Too deeply for mirth or song;
As the burdens press, and the cares distress
And the way grows weary and long?
 </p><p class="chorus">
Oh yes, He cares, I know He cares!
His heart is touched with my grief;
When the days are weary, the long
nights dreary,
I know my Saviour cares.
</p><p class="stanza">  
2. Does Jesus care when my way is dark
With a nameless dread and fear?
As the daylight fades into deep night shades,
Does He care enough to be near?
 </p><p class="chorus">
Oh yes, He cares, I know He cares!
His heart is touched with my grief;
When the days are weary, the long
nights dreary,
I know my Saviour cares.
</p><p class="stanza"> 
3. Does Jesus care when I've tried and failed
To resist some temptation strong;
When for my deep grief there is no relief,
Tho' my tears flow all the night long?
  </p><p class="chorus">
Oh yes, He cares, I know He cares!
His heart is touched with my grief;
When the days are weary, the long
nights dreary,
I know my Saviour cares.
</p><p class="stanza">  
4. Does Jesus care when I've said goodbye
To the dearest on earth to me,
And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks,
Is it aught to Him?  does He see? 
  </p><p class="chorus">
Oh yes, He cares, I know He cares!
His heart is touched with my grief;
When the days are weary, the long
nights dreary,
I know my Saviour cares.
