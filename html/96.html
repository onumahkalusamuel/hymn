1. Master, the tempest is raging!
The billows are tossing high!
The sky is o'ershadowed with blackness,
No shelter or help is nigh;
"Carest Thou not that we perish?"
How canst Thou lie asleep,
When each moment so madly is threatening
A grave in the angry deep?
</p><p class="chorus">
"The winds and the waves shall obey My will,
Peace, be still!"
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea,
Or demons or men, or whatever it be,
No water can swallow the ship where lies
The Master of ocean, and earth, and skies;
They all shall sweetly obey Thy will,
Peace, be still! Peace, be still!
They all shall sweetly obey Thy will:
Peace, peace, be still!
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Master, with anguish of spirit
I bow in my grief today;
The depths of my sad heart are troubled;
Oh, waken and save, I pray!
Torrents of sin and of anguish
Sweep o'er my sinking soul;
And I perish! I perish! dear Master;
O hasten, and take control!
</p><p class="chorus">
"The winds and the waves shall obey My will,
Peace, be still!"
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea,
Or demons or men, or whatever it be,
No water can swallow the ship where lies
The Master of ocean, and earth, and skies;
They all shall sweetly obey Thy will,
Peace, be still! Peace, be still!
They all shall sweetly obey Thy will:
Peace, peace, be still!
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Master, the terror is over,
The elements sweetly rest;
Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored,
And heaven's within my breast;
Linger, O blessed Redeemer!
Leave me alone no more;
And with joy I shall make the blest harbour,
And rest on the blissful shore.
</p><p class="chorus">
"The winds and the waves shall obey My will,
Peace, be still!"
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea,
Or demons or men, or whatever it be,
No water can swallow the ship where lies
The Master of ocean, and earth, and skies;
They all shall sweetly obey Thy will,
Peace, be still! Peace, be still!
They all shall sweetly obey Thy will:
Peace, peace, be still!
