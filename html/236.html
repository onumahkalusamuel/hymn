1. Lord God, the Holy Ghost,
In this accepted hour,
As on the day of Pentecost,
Descend in all Thy power!
</p><p class="stanza">
2. We meet with one accord
In our appointed place
And wait the promise of our Lord,
The Spirit of all grace.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Like mighty rushing wind
Upon the waves beneath,
Move with one impulse every mind;
One soul, one feeling breathe.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. The young, the old, inspire
With wisdom from above;
And give us hearts and tongues of fire,
To pray, and praise, and love.
</p><p class="stanza">
5. Spirit of light, explore
And chase our gloom away,
With lustre shining more and more
Unto the perfect day!
</p><p class="stanza">
6. Spirit of Truth, be Thou
In life and death our Guide!
O Spirit of Adoption, now
May we be sanctified.
