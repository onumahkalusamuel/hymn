1. How to reach the masses, men of every birth,
For an answer, Jesus gave the key:
"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
Will draw all men unto Me."
</p><p class="chorus">
Lift Him up, .... Lift Him up,....
Still He speaks from eternity:
"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
Will draw all men unto Me."
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Oh! the world is hungry for the Living Bread,
Lift the Saviour up for them to see;
Trust Him, and do not doubt the words that He said,
"I'll draw all men unto me."
</p><p class="chorus">
Lift Him up, .... Lift Him up,....
Still He speaks from eternity:
"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
Will draw all men unto Me."
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Don't exalt the preacher, don't exalt the pew,
Preach the Gospel simple, full and free;
Prove Him and you will find that promise is true,
"I'll draw all men unto me."
 </p><p class="chorus">
Lift Him up, .... Lift Him up,....
Still He speaks from eternity:
"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
Will draw all men unto Me."
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Lift Him up by living as a Christian ought,
Let the world in you the Saviour see;
Then men will gladly follow Him Who once taught,
"I'll draw all men unto Me."
 </p><p class="chorus">
Lift Him up, .... Lift Him up,....
Still He speaks from eternity:
"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
Will draw all men unto Me."
