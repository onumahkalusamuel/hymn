It is morning in my heart;
I am living in the sunlight of the day,
It is morning in my heart.

It is morning, it is morning in my heart
Jesus made the gloomy shadows all depart
Songs of gladness now I sing for since Jesus  is my King
It is morning, it is morning in my heart

2. I can hear the songbirds singing their refrain,
It is morning in my heart;
And I know that life for me begins again,
It is morning in my heart.

Songs of gladness now I sing for since Jesus  is my King

It is morning in my heart;
Ev'ry duty in the light of love I see;
It is morning in my heart.

It is morning in my heart;
I shall sing it when I reach the other shore,
It is morning in my heart.

Songs of gladness now I sing for since Jesus  is my King
