1. Speak a word, a loving word for Jesus,
Ev'rywhere you go;
Tell poor sinners how He died to save them
From eternal woe.
</p><p class="chorus">
Speak a word for Jesus, speak it quickly,
Swiftly glides the time away,...
Daily tell the wondrous story of the Master's glory,
Speak a loving word today.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Speak a word, a tender word for Jesus,
To the sin-sick soul;
Tell him Christ, who came to save the vilest,
Waits to make him whole.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Speak a word for Jesus, speak it quickly,
Swiftly glides the time away,...
Daily tell the wondrous story of the Master's glory,
Speak a loving word today.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Speak a word, a warning word for Jesus,
Speak it day by day,
Strive to lead some weak and wand'ring brother
In the narrow way.
</p><p class="chorus">
Speak a word for Jesus, speak it quickly,
Swiftly glides the time away,...
Daily tell the wondrous story of the Master's glory,
Speak a loving word today.
