1.Onward, Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
Looking unto Jesus 
Who is gone before;
Christ, the royal Master,
Leads against the foe;
Forward into battle,
See His banners go!
</p><p class="chorus">
Onward, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
Looking unto Jesus,
Who is gone before.
</p><p class="stanza"> 
2. At the name of Jesus
Satan's host doth flee;
On then, Christian soldiers,
On to victory!
Hell's foundations quiver
At the shout of praise:
Brothers, lift your voices, 
Loud your anthems raise.
</p><p class="chorus">
Onward, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
Looking unto Jesus,
Who is gone before.
</p><p class="stanza">
3.Like a mighty army 
Moves the church of God;
Brothers, we are treading
where the saints have trod.
We are not divided,
All one body we -
One in hope and doctrine,
One in charity.
</p><p class="chorus">
Onward, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
Looking unto Jesus,
Who is gone before.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Crowns and thrones may perish, 
kingdoms rise and wane;
But the church of Jesus
Constant will remain:
Gates of hell can never
'Gainst that church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise -
And that cannot fail.
</p><p class="chorus">
Onward, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
Looking unto Jesus,
Who is gone before.
</p><p class="stanza">
5. Onward then, ye people,
Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices 
In the triumph song:
"Glory, praise, and honour 
Unto Christ the King," -
This through countless ages 
Men and angels sing.
</p><p class="chorus">
Onward, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
Looking unto Jesus,
Who is gone before.
