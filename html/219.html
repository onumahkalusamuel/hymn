1. More holiness give me, more striving within;
More patience in suffering, more sorrow for sin;
More faith in my Saviour, more sense of His care;
More joy in His service, more purpose in prayer.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. More gratitude give me, more trust in the Lord;
More zeal for His glory, more hope in His Word;
More tears for His sorrows, more pain at His grief;
More meekness in trial, more praise for relief.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. More purity give me, more strength to o'ercome;
More freedom from earth-stains, more longings for home;
More fit for the kingdom, more used would I be;
More blessed and holy, more, Saviour, like Thee.
