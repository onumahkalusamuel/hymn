1. I do not ask to see the way
My feet will have to tread;
But only that my soul may feed
Upon the living Bread.
'Tis better far that I should walk
By faith close to His side -
I may not know the way I go,
But oh, I know my Guide.
</p><p class="chorus">
His love.... can never fail,
His love ....can never fail,
My soul is satisfied to know
His love can never fail.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. And if my feet would go astray,
They cannot, for I know
That Jesus guides my falt'ring steps.
As joyfully I go,
And tho' I may not see His face,
My faith is strong and clear,
That in each hour of sore distress
My Saviour will be near.
</p><p class="chorus">
His love.... can never fail,
His love ....can never fail,
My soul is satisfied to know
His love can never fail.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. I will not fear, tho' darkness come
Abroad o'er all the land,
If I may only feel the touch
Of His own loving hand.
And tho' I tremble when I think
How weak I am, how frail,
My soul is satisfied to know
His love can never fail.
</p><p class="chorus">
His love.... can never fail,
His love ....can never fail,
My soul is satisfied to know
His love can never fail.
