1. Fading away like the stars of the morning,
Losing their light in the glorious sunâ€”
Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling,
Only remembered by what we have done.
</p><p class="chorus">
Only remembered, only remembered,
Only remembered by what we have done;
Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling,
Only remembered by what we have done.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Shall we be missed, tho' by others succeeded,
Reaping the fields we in spring time have sown?
Yes, but the sowers must pass from their labours,
Ever remembered by what they have done.
</p><p class="chorus">
Only remembered, only remembered,
Only remembered by what we have done;
Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling,
Only remembered by what we have done.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Only the truth that in life we have spoken,
Only the seed that on earth we have sown;
These shall pass onward when we are forgotten,
Fruits of the harvest and what we have done.
</p><p class="chorus">
Only remembered, only remembered,
Only remembered by what we have done;
Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling,
Only remembered by what we have done.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Oh, when the Saviour shall make up His jewels,
When shall His weary and faithful disciples
All be remembered by what they have done.
</p><p class="chorus">
Only remembered, only remembered,
Only remembered by what we have done;
Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling,
Only remembered by what we have done.
