1. On the cross crucified,
In great sorrow He died; 
The Giver of life was He - 
Yet my lord was despised and rejected of men,
This Jesus of Calvary 
</p><p class="chorus">
He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities,
Surely he bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Price for healing was paid,
As those cruel stripes were made,
Within Pilate's judgement hall-
Now his suff'ring afford perfect healing for all,
This wonderful Healer's mine 
</p><p class="chorus">
He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities,
Surely he bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Came the leper to Christ, 
Saying "Surely I know,
That thou, Lord canst make me whole." -
When his great faith was seen Jesus said, "Yes, I will." 
And touched him and made him clean. 
</p><p class="chorus">
He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities,
Surely he bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. He has healed my sick soul, 
Made me ev'ry whit whole, 
And He'll do the same to you
He's the same yesterday and today and for ever,
This Healer of men today.
</p><p class="chorus">
He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities,
Surely he bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.
