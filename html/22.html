1. Simply trusting every day,
Trusting through a stormy way,
Even when my faith is small,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.
</p><p class="chorus">
Trusting as the moments fly,
Trusting as the days go by,
Trusting him whate'er befall,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Brightly doth his Spirit shine
Into this poor heart of mine;
While He leads I cannot fall,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.
</p><p class="chorus">
Trusting as the moments fly,
Trusting as the days go by,
Trusting him whate'er befall,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Singing, if my way be clear,
Praying, if the path be drear,
If in danger for him call,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.
</p><p class="chorus">
Trusting as the moments fly,
Trusting as the days go by,
Trusting him whate'er befall,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Trusting Him while life shall last,
Trusting him till earth be past;
Till within the jasper wall,
Trusting Jesus, that is all. 
</p><p class="chorus">
Trusting as the moments fly,
Trusting as the days go by,
Trusting him whate'er befall,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.
