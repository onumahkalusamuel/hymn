1.Will your anchor hold in the storms of life?
When the clouds unfold their wings of strife;
When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain,
Will your anchor drift or firm remain?
</p><p class="chorus">
We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
Grounded firm and deep in the
Saviour's love.
</p><p class="stanza">
2.It is safely moored 'twill the storm withstand,
For 'tis well secured by the Saviour's hand;
And the cables passed from His heart to mine,
Can defy the blast, through strength divine.
</p><p class="chorus">
We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
Grounded firm and deep in the
Saviour's love.
</p><p class="stanza">
3.It will firmly hold in the straits of fear,
When the breakers have told the reef is near;
Though the tempest rave and the wild winds blow,
Not an angry wave shall our bark o'er flow.
</p><p class="chorus">
We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
Grounded firm and deep in the
Saviour's love.
</p><p class="stanza">
4.It will surely hold in the floods of death,
When the waters cold chill our latest breath,
On the rising tide it can never fail,
While our hopes abide within the veil!
</p><p class="chorus">
We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
Grounded firm and deep in the
Saviour's love.
</p><p class="stanza">
5. When our eyes behold, through the gathering night
The city of gold, our harbour bright,
We shall anchor fast by the heavenly shore,
With the storms all past for evermore.
</p><p class="chorus">
We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
Grounded firm and deep in the
Saviour's love.
