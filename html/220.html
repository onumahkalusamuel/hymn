1. When I saw the cleansing fountain 
Open wide for all my sin,
I obeyed the Spirit's wooing
When He said "Wilt thou be clean?"
</p><p class="chorus">
I will praise Him, I will praise Him,
praise Him,
Praise the Lamb for sinners slain:...
Give him glory all ye people,
For His blood has washed away my stain.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Though the way seemed straight and narrow, 
All I claimed was swept away;
My ambition, plans and wishes, 
At my feet in ashes lay.
</p><p class="chorus">
I will praise Him, I will praise Him,
praise Him,
Praise the Lamb for sinners slain:...
Give him glory all ye people,
For His blood has washed away my stain.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Then God's fire upon the altar
Of my heart was set aflame;
I shall never cease to praise Him, 
Glory! glory! to His name.
</p><p class="chorus">
I will praise Him, I will praise Him,
praise Him,
Praise the Lamb for sinners slain:...
Give him glory all ye people,
For His blood has washed away my stain.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Blessed be the name of Jesus, 
I'm so glad He took me in;
He has pardoned my transgressions, 
He has cleansed my heart from sin.
</p><p class="chorus">
I will praise Him, I will praise Him,
praise Him,
Praise the Lamb for sinners slain:...
Give him glory all ye people,
For His blood has washed away my stain.
