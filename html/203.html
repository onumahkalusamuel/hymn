1. There is no love like the love of Jesus,
Never to fade or fall,
Till into the rest of the peace of God
He has gather'd us all.
</p><p class="chorus">
Jesus' love, precious love,
Boundless, and pure, and free;
Oh, turn to that love, weary
wand'ring soul;
Jesus pleadeth with thee!
</p><p class="stanza">
2. There is no eye like the eye of Jesus,
Piercing so far away;
Ne'er out of the sight of its tender light
Can the wanderer stray.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Jesus' love, precious love,
Boundless, and pure, and free;
Oh, turn to that love, weary
wand'ring soul;
Jesus pleadeth with thee!
</p><p class="stanza">
3. There is no voice like the voice of Jesus,
Tender and sweet its chime;
Like musical ring of a flowing spring,
In the bright summertime.
</p><p class="chorus">
Jesus' love, precious love,
Boundless, and pure, and free;
Oh, turn to that love, weary
wand'ring soul;
Jesus pleadeth with thee!
</p><p class="stanza">
4. There is no heart like the heart of Jesus,
Filled with a tender love;
No throb nor throe that our hearts can know;
But He feels it above.
</p><p class="chorus">
Jesus' love, precious love,
Boundless, and pure, and free;
Oh, turn to that love, weary
wand'ring soul;
Jesus pleadeth with thee!
