1.O Lord my God! When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the works thy hand hath made,
I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder,
Thy power thro' out the universe displayed,
</p><p class="chorus">
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee;
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul,	my Saviour God, to Thee;
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
</p><p class="stanza">
2. When through the woods and forest glades I wander,
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze;
</p><p class="chorus">
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee;
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul,	my Saviour God, to Thee;
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
</p><p class="stanza">
3. And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
Sent him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin;
</p><p class="chorus">
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee;
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul,	my Saviour God, to Thee;
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
</p><p class="stanza">
4. When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation,
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
And there proclaim, my God, how great thou art!
</p><p class="chorus">
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee;
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul,	my Saviour God, to Thee;
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
