1. I'm pressing on the upward way,
New heights I'm gaining every day;
Still praying as I onward bound,
"Lord, plant my feet on higher ground."
  </p><p class="chorus">
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith, on heaven's table-land;
Where love and joy, and light abound,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Though some may dwell where those abound,
My constant aim is higher ground.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith, on heaven's table-land;
Where love and joy, and light abound,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Beyond the mist I fain would rise, 
To rest beneath unclouded skies,
Above earth's turmoil peace is found,
By those who dwell on higher ground.
  </p><p class="chorus">
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith, on heaven's table-land;
Where love and joy, and light abound,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
</p><p class="stanza">
4.	I long to scale the utmost height
Though rough the way, and hard the fight,
My song, while climbing, shall resound, 
Lord, lead me on to higher ground.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith, on heaven's table-land;
Where love and joy, and light abound,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
</p><p class="stanza">
5. Lord, lead me up the mountain side,
I dare not climb without my Guide;
And, heaven gained, I'll gaze around, 
With grateful heart from higher ground.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith, on heaven's table-land;
Where love and joy, and light abound,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
