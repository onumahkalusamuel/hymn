1. Are you longing for the fullness
Of the blessing of the Lord
In your heart and life today?
Claim the promise of your Father;
Come according to His Word,
In the blessed old-time way.
 </p><p class="chorus">
He will fill your heart today to
overflowing.
As the Lord commandeth you,
"Bring your vessels, not a few."
He will fill your heart today to
overflowing
With the Holy Ghost and power.

2. Bring your empty earthen vessels,
Clean through Jesus' precious blood.
Come, ye needy, one and all;
And in human consecration
Wait before the throne of God
Till the Holy Ghost shall fall.
</p><p class="chorus">
He will fill your heart today to
overflowing.
As the Lord commandeth you,
"Bring your vessels, not a few."
He will fill your heart today to
overflowing
With the Holy Ghost and power.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Like the cruse of oil unfailing
Is His grace forever more,
And His love unchanging still;
And according to His promise,
With the Holy Ghost and power
He will every vessel fill.
 </p><p class="chorus">
He will fill your heart today to
overflowing.
As the Lord commandeth you,
"Bring your vessels, not a few."
He will fill your heart today to
overflowing
With the Holy Ghost and power.
