1. I've found the "Pearl of greatest price,"
My heart doth sing for joy;
And sing I must, for Christ I have
Oh, what a Christ have I!
</p><p class="stanza">
2. My Christ, He is "the Lord of lords,"
The Sovereign "King of kings, "
The risen "Sun of Righteousness,
With healing in His wings."
</p><p class="stanza">
3. My Christ, He is "the Tree of Life,"
That in God's Eden grows;
The living "clear as crystal" stream
Whence life for ever flows.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Christ is my Meat, Christ is my Drink,
My Medicine, and my Health;
My Portion, mine Inheritance,
Yea, all my boundless Wealth.
