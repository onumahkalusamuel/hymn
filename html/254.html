1. Lower and lower, dear Lord, at Thy feet,
Seeking Thy Spirit Thy mercy so sweet;
Down in our need, blessed Master, we fall,
Lower and lower; be Thou all in all.
</p><p class="chorus">
Lower and lower, down at Thy cross,
All the world's treasure counting but dross;
Down at Thy feet, blessed Saviour, we fall,
Lower, still lower, Christ all in all.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Lower and lower, dear Saviour, we pray,
Losing the self life still more ev'ry day;
Weak and unworthy, we're looking above;
Empty us, Jesus; then fill us with love.
</p><p class="chorus">
Lower and lower, down at Thy cross,
All the world's treasure counting but dross;
Down at Thy feet, blessed Saviour, we fall,
Lower, still lower, Christ all in all.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Lower and lower; yet higher we rise,
Lifted in Jesus, led on to the skies;
Humbly we follow the way of the cross
Then, crowns of glory, and again for all loss.
</p><p class="chorus">
Lower and lower, down at Thy cross,
All the world's treasure counting but dross;
Down at Thy feet, blessed Saviour, we fall,
Lower, still lower, Christ all in all.
