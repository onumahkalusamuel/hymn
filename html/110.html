1. I'll tell to all that God is love;
For the world has never known
The great compassion of His heart
For the wayward and the lone.
</p><p class="chorus">
Till the whole world knows,
Till the whole world knows,
I will shout and sing
Of Christ my King,
Till the whole world knows
</p><p class="stanza">
2. I'll tell of mercy's boundless tide, 
Like the waters of the sea,
That covers ev'ry sin of man;
'Tis salvation full and free.
</p><p class="chorus">
Till the whole world knows,
Till the whole world knows,
I will shout and sing
Of Christ my King,
Till the whole world knows
</p><p class="stanza">
3. I'll tell of grace that keeps the soul,
Of abiding peace within, 
Of faith that overcomes the world,
With its tumult and its din.
</p><p class="chorus">
Till the whole world knows,
Till the whole world knows,
I will shout and sing
Of Christ my King,
Till the whole world knows
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Eternal glory is the goal 
That awaits the sons of light;
Eternal darkness, black as death, 
For the children of the night.
</p><p class="chorus">
Till the whole world knows,
Till the whole world knows,
I will shout and sing
Of Christ my King,
Till the whole world knows
