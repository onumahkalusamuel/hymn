1. "Almost persuaded:" now to believe;
"Almost persuaded:" Christ to receive;
Seems now some soul to say,
"Go, Spirit, go Thy way:
Some more convenient day
On Thee I'll call."
</p><p class="stanza">
2. "Almost persuaded:" come, come today;
"Almost persuaded:" turn not away!
Jesus invites you here,
Angels are lingering near
Prayers rise from hearts so dear,
O wanderer, come!
</p><p class="stanza">
3. "Almost persuaded:" harvest is past!
"Almost persuaded:" doom comes at last!
"Almost" cannot avail;
"Almost" is but to fail!
Sad, sad, that bitter wail-
"Almost"- but lost!
