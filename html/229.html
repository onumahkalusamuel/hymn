1. Ho, my comrades! see the signal,
Waving in the sky!
Reinforcements now appearing,
Victory is nigh.
</p><p class="chorus">
"Hold the fort, for I am coming,"
Jesus signals still;
Wave the answer back to heaven,
By Thy grace we will.

2. See the mighty host advancing,
Satan leading on:
Mighty men around us falling,
Courage almost gone!
</p><p class="chorus">
"Hold the fort, for I am coming,"
Jesus signals still;
Wave the answer back to heaven,
By Thy grace we will.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. See the glorious banner waving!
Hear the trumpet blow!
In our Leader's name we'll triumph,
Over every foe.
</p><p class="chorus">
"Hold the fort, for I am coming,"
Jesus signals still;
Wave the answer back to heaven,
By Thy grace we will.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Fierce and long the battle rages,
But our help is near;
Onward comes our great Commander,
Cheer, my comrades cheer. 
</p><p class="chorus">
"Hold the fort, for I am coming,"
Jesus signals still;
Wave the answer back to heaven,
By Thy grace we will.
