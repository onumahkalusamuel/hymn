1. Burn fire of God! my ransomed soul possessing;
Pure fire Thou art, and I would dwell in Thee.
Light of my life, true source of ev'ry blessing,
Grant all my days one holy flame to be.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Burn fire of God! Thy grace and glory knowing,
My cleansed heart shall be all fire within:
Love all-constraining, tenderness o'erflowing,
One kindling passion other lives to win.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Burn fire of God! Thy cloven tongue bestowing,
Baptising me with heavenly energy.
Touched with live coals from off Thine altar glowing,
My purged  lips shall speak alone of Thee.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Burn fire of God! with seven-fold refining,
Till, mirrored from my deeps Thine eyes shall see
In purest gold Thy perfect image shining:
Thy Christ revealed in clear irradiancy.
</p><p class="stanza">
5. Burn fire of God! by Thine own love transcending,
Let all I hold be Thine, and Thine alone!
Heart, mind and will a sacrifice ascending,
Consumed by fire from out Thy fiery Throne.
