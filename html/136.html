1. Years I spent in vanity and pride,
Caring not my Lord was crucified,
Knowing not it was for me He died
On Calvary.
</p><p class="chorus">
Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied to me;
There my burdened soul found liberty
At Calvary.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. By God's Word at last my sin I learned;
Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned,
Till my guilty soul imploring turned
To Calvary.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied to me;
There my burdened soul found liberty
At Calvary.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Now I've given to Jesus everything,
Now I gladly own Him as my King,
Now my raptured soul can only sing 
Of Calvary.
</p><p class="chorus">
Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied to me;
There my burdened soul found liberty
At Calvary.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Oh! the love that drew salvation's plan!
Oh! the grace that brought it down to man!
Oh! the mighty gulf that God did span 
At Calvary.
</p><p class="chorus">
Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied to me;
There my burdened soul found liberty
At Calvary.
