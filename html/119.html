1. Many a soul in the battle of life 
Trembles with fear at the din and the strife, 
Bearing alone, amid trial and care,
Burdens and sorrows God bids you to share.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Do something for others,
Something for others today!...
Duty demands it, and Jesus commands it!
Do something for others today.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Many in doubt or in fear of the way
Mutely appeal for your guidance today;
On your demeanour the choice may depend-
Are you concerned for the stranger or friend?
</p><p class="chorus">
Do something for others,
Something for others today!...
Duty demands it, and Jesus commands it!
Do something for others today.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Many, disheartened by cruel deceit,
Broken and worn by the pangs of defeat, 
Doubting, despairingly, helplessly stand, 
Waiting, perhaps, for your strengthening hand.
</p><p class="chorus">
Do something for others,
Something for others today!...
Duty demands it, and Jesus commands it!
Do something for others today.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Many are turning away from the right 
Into the maze of the shadows of night;
Go to them, speak to them, over them pray, 
Help them, support them-do something today.
</p><p class="chorus">
Do something for others,
Something for others today!...
Duty demands it, and Jesus commands it!
Do something for others today.
