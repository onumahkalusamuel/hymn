1. O day of rest and gladness,
O day of joy and light,
O balm of care and sadness, 
Most beautiful, most bright:
On Thee, the high and lowly,
Through ages joined in tune,
Sing: holy, holy, holy,
To the great God Triune.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. On Thee, at the creation, 
The light first had its birth;
On Thee, for our salvation, 
Christ rose from depths of earth;
On Thee, our Lord, victorious 
The Spirit sent from Heaven:
And thus on Thee, most glorious, 
A triple light was given.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Thou art a port, protected
From storms that round us rise;
A garden, intersected 
With streams of paradise;
Thou art a cooling fountain 
In life's dry, dreary sand;
From thee, like Pisgah's mountain,
We view our promised land.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Thou art a holy ladder, 
Where angels go and come;
Each Sunday finds us gladder, 
Nearer to heaven, our home;
A day of sweet refection, 
Thou art a day of love,
A day of resurrection 
From earth to things above.
</p><p class="stanza">
5. Today on weary nations 
The heavenly manna falls;
To holy convocations
The silver trumpet calls,
Where Gospel light is glowing 
With pure and radiant beams,
And living water flowing, 
With soul-refreshing streams.
</p><p class="stanza">
6. New graces ever gaining
From, this our day of rest,
We reach the rest remaining 
To spirits of the blest.
To Holy Ghost be praises, 
To Father, and to Son;
The church her voice upraises 
To Thee, blest Three in One.
