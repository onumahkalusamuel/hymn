1. Another year of dawning -
A path unknown, untried.
'Twould fill me with foreboding.
Had I no hand to guide;
But He who walked beside me
All through the yesteryear,
Whatever may betide me,
Has promised to be near.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Another year with Jesus!
Ah, then, no dread I know.
His love is ever precious,
Howe'er the winds may blow.
E'en when the storm is fiercest,
In Him my soul may rest,
And find sweet peace and comfort
Upon His loving breast.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Another year to trust Him --
Yes, I can trust Him still,
Who never yet has failed me
As I have sought His will.
His rod and staff He giveth
To be my strength and stay,
And tenderly He leadeth
Along the homeward way.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Another year to serve Him
To labour for Him here,
E'en while the shadows lengthen
And night is drawing near.
I know not when He'll call me
To lay my sickle by -
Oh, may I then be faithful
While now the moments fly!
</p><p class="stanza">
5. Another year to love Him,
Whom I have loved so long;
Another year to praise Him
In glad triumphant song.
Whate'er the future holdeth
Of sorrow, toil, or pain,
His precious love endureth
Forevermore the same.
</p><p class="stanza">
6. Another year with Jesus!
I thank Three, Lord, today
For Thy unfailing presence
Along life's rugged way.
Guide me, O blest Redeemer,
Teach me to do Thy will,
And Thine own perfect purpose
In me each day to fulfill.
