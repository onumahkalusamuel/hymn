1. Blessed are the pure in heart, 
They have learned the angel art, 
While on earth in heaven to be, 
God, by sense unseen, to see.
Cleansed form sin's offensive stain, 
Fellowship with Him they gain;
Nearness, likeness to their Lord, 
Their exceeding great reward.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Worshipping in spirit now, 
In His inner court they bow-
Bow before the brightening veil, 
God's own radiance through it hail.
Serious, simple of intent, 
Teachably intelligent, 
Rapt, they search the written Word
Till His very voice is heard.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. In creation Him they own,
Meet Him in its haunts, alone;
Most amidst  its Sabbath calm,
Morning light and evening balm.
Him they still through busier life
Trust in pain, and care, and strife;
These, like clouds, o'er noontide blaze,
Temper, not conceal, His rays.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Hallowed thus their every breath:
Dying, they shall not see death,
With the Lord in paradise, 
Till, like His, their bodies rise.
Nearer than the seraphim
In their flesh shall saints see Him,
With the Father, in the Son, 
Through the Spirit, ever one.
