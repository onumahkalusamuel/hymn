1.Is there a heart o'er-bound by sorrow?
Is there a life weighed down by care?
Come to the cross, each burden bearing,
All your anxiety-leave it there.	
</p><p class="chorus">
All your anxiety, all your care,
Bring to the mercy seat, leave
it there;
Never a burden He cannot bear,
Never a friend like Jesus.
</p><p class="stanza">           
2.No other friend so keen to help you;
No other friend so quick to hear;
No other place to leave your burden;
No other one to hear your prayer.	
</p><p class="chorus">
All your anxiety, all your care,
Bring to the mercy seat, leave
it there;
Never a burden He cannot bear,
Never a friend like Jesus.
</p><p class="stanza">           
3.Come then, at once, delay no longer;
Heed His entreaty, kind and sweet;
You need not fear a disappointment;
You shall find peace at the mercy seat.	
</p><p class="chorus">
All your anxiety, all your care,
Bring to the mercy seat, leave
it there;
Never a burden He cannot bear,
Never a friend like Jesus.
