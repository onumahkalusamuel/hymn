1. There's a great day coming, 
A great day coming,
There's a great day coming by and by;
When the saints and the sinners shall be 
parted right and left,
Are you ready for that day to come?
</p><p class="chorus">
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Are you ready for the judgment day?
Are you ready? Are you ready?
For the judgment day?
</p><p class="stanza">
2. There's a bright day coming,
A bright day coming;
There's a bright day coming by and by.
But its brightness shall only come to 
them that love the Lord,
Are you ready for that day to come?
</p><p class="chorus">
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Are you ready for the judgment day?
Are you ready? Are you ready?
For the judgment day?
</p><p class="stanza">
3. There's a sad day coming, a sad day coming;
There's a sad day coming by and by;
When the sinner shall hear his doom: 
"Depart, I know you not'"
Are you ready for that day to come?
</p><p class="chorus">
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Are you ready for the judgment day?
Are you ready? Are you ready?
For the judgment day?
