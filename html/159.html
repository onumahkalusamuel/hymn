1. Why do you wait, dear brother,
Oh, why do you tarry so long?
Your Saviour is waiting to give you
A place in His sanctified throng.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Why not? Why not?
Why not come to Him now?
Why not? Why not?
Why not come to Him now?
</p><p class="stanza">
2. What do you hope, dear brother,
To gain by a further delay?
There's no one to save you but Jesus,
There's no other way but His way.
  </p><p class="chorus">
Why not? Why not?
Why not come to Him now?
Why not? Why not?
Why not come to Him now?
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Do you not feel, dear brother,
His Spirit now striving within?
Oh, why not accept His salvation,
And throw off your burden of sin?
 </p><p class="chorus">
Why not? Why not?
Why not come to Him now?
Why not? Why not?
Why not come to Him now?
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Why do you wait, dear brother?
The harvest is passing away;
Your Saviour is longing to bless you,
There are danger and death in delay!
 </p><p class="chorus">
Why not? Why not?
Why not come to Him now?
Why not? Why not?
Why not come to Him now?
