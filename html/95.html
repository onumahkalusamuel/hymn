1. COME, Saviour, Jesus, from above!
Assist me with thy heavenly grace;
Empty my heart of earthly love,
And for thyself prepare the place.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. O let thy sacred presence fill,
And set my longing spirit free!
Which pants to have no other will,
But day and night to feast on Thee.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. While in this region here below,
No other good will I pursue;
I'll bid this world of noise and show,
With all its glittering snares, adieu!
</p><p class="stanza">
4. That path with humble speed I'll seek,
In which my Saviour's footsteps shine;
Nor will I hear, nor will I speak,
Of any other love but Thine.
</p><p class="stanza">
5. Henceforth may no profane delight
Divide this consecrated soul;
Possess it thou, who hast the right,
As Lord and Master of the whole.
</p><p class="stanza">
6. Wealth, honour, pleasure, and what else
This short-enduring world can give,
Tempt as ye will, my soul repels,
To Christ alone resolved to live.
</p><p class="stanza">
7. Thee I can love, and thee alone,
With pure delight and inward bliss:
To know thou tak'st me for Thine own,
O what a happiness is this!
</p><p class="stanza">
8. Nothing on earth do I desire,
But thy pure love within my breast;
This, only this, will I require,
And freely give up all the rest.
