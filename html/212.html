1. Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
Doth his successive journeys run;
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
Till sun shall rise and set no more. 
</p><p class="stanza">
2. For Him shall endless prayer be made, 
And praises throng to crown His head;
His name like sweet perfume shall rise
with every morning sacrifice.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. People and realms of every tongue
Dwell on His love with sweetest song;
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their young hosannas to His name.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Blessings abound where'er He reigns;
The prisoner leaps to lose his chains;
The weary find eternal rest;
And all the sons of want are blest.
</p><p class="stanza">
5. Where He displays His healing power;
Death and the curse are known no more, 
In Him the tribes of Adam boast
More blessings than their father lost.
</p><p class="stanza">
6. Let every creature rise and bring,
Its greatest honours to our King;
Angels descend with songs again,
And earth prolong the joyful strain.
