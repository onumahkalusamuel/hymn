1. Faith of our fathers, living still
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword,
O how our hearts beat high with joy
Whene'er we hear that glorious word!
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death.   
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Faith of our fathers, we will strive
To win all nations unto thee,
And through the truth that comes from God
Mankind shall then indeed be free;
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Faith of our fathers, we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife,
And preach thee, too, as love knows how
By kindly words and virtuous life;
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death.
