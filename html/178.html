1. Like the woman at the well, I was seeking
For things that could not satisfy;
And then I heard my Saviour speaking:
"Draw from my well that never shall run dry."
 </p><p class="chorus">
Fill my cup, Lord, - I lift it up Lord!
Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
Bread of heaven feed me till I want no more-
Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!
</p><p class="stanza">
2. There are millions in this world who are craving
The pleasure earthly things afford;
But none can match the wondrous treasure
That I find in Jesus Christ, my Lord.
  </p><p class="chorus">
Fill my cup, Lord, - I lift it up Lord!
Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
Bread of heaven feed me till I want no more-
Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!
</p><p class="stanza">
3. So my brother if the things this world gave you
Leave hungers that won't pass away;
My blessed Lord will come and save you,
If you kneel to Him and humbly pray: 
 </p><p class="chorus">
Fill my cup, Lord, - I lift it up Lord!
Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
Bread of heaven feed me till I want no more-
Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!
