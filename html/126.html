1. Great God of wonders! all thy ways
Display the attributes divine;
But countless acts of pard'ning grace
Beyond thine other wonders shine:
</p><p class="chorus">
Who is a pard'ning God like thee?
Or who has grace so rich and free?
</p><p class="stanza">
2. In wonder lost, with trembling joy
We take the pardon of our God;
Pardon for crimes of deepest dye,
A pardon bought with Jesus blood:
</p><p class="chorus">
Who is a pard'ning God like thee?
Or who has grace so rich and free?
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Pardon - from an offended God!
Pardon - for sins of deepest dye!
Pardon - bestowed through Jesus' blood!
Pardon - that brings the rebel nigh!
</p><p class="chorus">
Who is a pard'ning God like thee?
Or who has grace so rich and free?
</p><p class="stanza">
4. O may this strange, this matchless grace,
This God-like miracle of love,
Fill the wide earth with grateful praise,
As now it fills the choirs above!
</p><p class="chorus">
Who is a pard'ning God like thee?
Or who has grace so rich and free?
