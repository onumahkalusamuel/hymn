1. Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
Ye soldiers of the cross;
Lift high His royal banner, 
It must not suffer loss:
From vict'ry unto vict'ry
His army shall He lead,
Till every foe is vanquished,
And Christ is Lord indeed.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
The trumpet call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict,
In this His glorious day.
Ye that are men now serve Him,
against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger,
And strength to strength oppose.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
Stand in His strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you,
Ye dare not trust your own.
Put on the gospel armour, 
And watching unto prayer;
Where duty calls or danger,
Be never wanting there. 
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Stand up! stand up for Jesus!
The strife will not be long;
This day the noise of battle,
The next the victor's song:
To him that overcometh, 
A crown of life shall be;
He with the King of glory
Shall reign eternally.
