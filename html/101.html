1. He knows the bitter, weary way,
The endless striving day by day,
The souls that weep, the souls that pray,
My Father knows, my Fathers knows
</p><p class="stanza">
2. He knows when faint and worn we sink,
How deep the pain, how near the brink
Of dark despair we pause and shrink,
My Father knows, my Fathers knows
</p><p class="stanza">
3. He knows how hard the fight has been,
The clouds that come our lives between, 
The wounds the world has never seen;
My Father knows, my Fathers knows
</p><p class="stanza">
4. He knows! oh, heart, take up thy cross,
And know earth's treasures are but dross
And all will prove as gain, not loss;
My Father knows, my Fathers knows
