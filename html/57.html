1. Ho, reapers in the whitened harvest
Oft feeble, faint, and few;
Come, wait upon the blessed Master,
Our strength He will renew.
</p><p class="chorus">
"For they that wait upon the Lord...
Shall renew... their strength;
They shall mount up with wings,
They shall mount up with wings as eagles
They shall run... and not be weary;
They shall walk and not faint;
They shall run... and not be weary;
They shall walk and not faint;
They shall run and not be weary
Shall walk and not faint."
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Too oft a-weary and discouraged,
We pour a sad complaint;
Believing in a living Saviour,
Why should we ever faint?
</p><p class="chorus">
"For they that wait upon the Lord...
Shall renew... their strength;
They shall mount up with wings,
They shall mount up with wings as eagles
They shall run... and not be weary;
They shall walk and not faint;
They shall run... and not be weary;
They shall walk and not faint;
They shall run and not be weary
Shall walk and not faint."
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Rejoice! for He is with us alway,
Lo, even to the end!
Look up! take courage and go forward -
All needed grace He'll send!
</p><p class="chorus">
"For they that wait upon the Lord...
Shall renew... their strength;
They shall mount up with wings,
They shall mount up with wings as eagles
They shall run... and not be weary;
They shall walk and not faint;
They shall run... and not be weary;
They shall walk and not faint;
They shall run and not be weary
Shall walk and not faint."
