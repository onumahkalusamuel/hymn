1. No tears in heaven, no sorrows given.
All will be glory in that land;
There'll be no sadness, all will be gladness,
When we shall join that happy band.
</p><p class="chorus">
No tears, no tears, no tears up there,
Sorrow and pain will all have flown;
No tears, no tears, no tears up there;
No tears in heaven will be known.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Glory is waiting, waiting up yonder,
Where we shall spend an endless day;
There with our Saviour, we'll be forever,
Where no more sorrow can dismay.
 </p><p class="chorus">
No tears, no tears, no tears up there,
Sorrow and pain will all have flown;
No tears, no tears, no tears up there;
No tears in heaven will be known.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Some morning yonder, we'll cease to ponder
O'er things this life has bro't to view;
All will be clearer, loved ones be dearer
In heav'n where all will be made new.
</p><p class="chorus">
No tears, no tears, no tears up there,
Sorrow and pain will all have flown;
No tears, no tears, no tears up there;
No tears in heaven will be known.
