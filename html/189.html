1. Take time to be holy, speak oft with thy Lord;
Abide in Him always, and feed on His Word.
Make friends of God's children; Help those who are weak;
Forgetting in nothing His blessing to seek.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Take time to be holy, the world rushes on;
Spend much time in secret with Jesus alone;
By looking to Jesus, like Him thou shalt be;
Thy friends in thy conduct His likeness shall see.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Take time to be holy, let Him be thy Guide,
And run not before Him, whatever betide;
In joy or in sorrow, still follow thy Lord,
And, looking to Jesus, still trust in His Word.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Take time to be holy, be calm in thy soul;
Each thought and each temper beneath His control;
Thus led by His Spirit to fountains of love,
Thou soon shalt be fitted for service above.
