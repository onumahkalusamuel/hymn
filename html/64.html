1. On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suff'ring and shame;
And I love that old cross where the 
dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.
</p><p class="chorus">
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,...
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,...
And exchange it some day for a crown.
</p><p class="stanza">
2.	Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,
To bear it to dark Calvary.
</p><p class="chorus">
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,...
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,...
And exchange it some day for a crown.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.
</p><p class="chorus">
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,...
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,...
And exchange it some day for a crown.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home 
far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.
</p><p class="chorus">
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,...
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,...
And exchange it some day for a crown.
