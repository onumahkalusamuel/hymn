1. The thing my God doth hate
That I no more may do,
Thy creature, Lord, again create,
And all my soul renew;
</p><p class="stanza">
2. My soul shall then, like Thine,
Abhor the thing unclean,
And, sanctified by love divine,
For ever cease from sin.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. That blessed law of Thine,
Jesus, to me impart;
The Spirit's law of life divine,
O write it in my heart!
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Implant it deep within,
Whence it may ne'er remove,
The law of liberty from sin,
The perfect law of love.
</p><p class="stanza">
5. Thy nature be my law,
Thy spotless sanctity,
And sweetly every moment draw
My happy soul to thee.
</p><p class="stanza">
6. Soul of my soul remain!
Who didst for all fulfil,
In me, O Lord, fulfil again
Thy heavenly Father's will!
