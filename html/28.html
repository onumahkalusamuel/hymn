1. All that drew me I have left behind
Here in Canaan better joys I find;
Peace abiding, blessings unconfined,
For I'm living in Canaan now.

I am living in Canaan now,
Where the showers of blessing abound,
Where the riches of grace in plenty are found,
I am living in Canaan now

2.Safe abiding I will never fear,
For my Saviour ever will be near;
When I call Him He will always hear,
For I'm living in Canaan now.

Where the showers of blessing abound,
Where the riches of grace in plenty are found,

3.I am drinking from a ceaseless well;
Here in Canaan where I love to dwell,
So to others I am glad to tell,
That I'm living in Canaan now.

Where the showers of blessing abound,
Where the riches of grace in plenty are found,
I am living in Canaan now

Unto Jesus, my Redeemer King,
For His mercies I will shout and sing,
For I'm living in Canaan now.

I am living in Canaan now,
Where the showers of blessing abound,
Where the riches of grace in plenty are found,
I am living in Canaan now
