Let all its blessings outflow;
It will supply you each moment
Take it wherever you go!

Take it wherever you go, (you go;)

Sent down from above,
Oh, take it wherever you go!

Sweeter each day it will grow;
Somewhere some heart will be waiting
Take it wherever you go!

Tell it to hearts plung'd in woe;
This word of gracious redemption
Take it wherever you go!

Sinners unpardon'd may know
God's path from sin unto safety
Take it wherever you go!

Take it wherever you go, (you go;)
God's message of love
Sent down from above,
Oh, take it wherever you go!
