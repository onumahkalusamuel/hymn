1. The church's one foundation 
Is Jesus Christ her Lord; 
She is His new creation 
By water and the Word. 
From Heav'n he came and sought her 
To be his holy bride; 
With his own blood He bought her, 
And for her life He died. 
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Elect from every nation, 
Yet one o'er all the earth; 
Her charter of salvation, 
One Lord, one faith, one birth; 
One holy name she blesses, 
Partakes one holy food, 
And to one hope she presses, 
With every grace endued.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Though with a scornful wonder 
Men see her sore oppressed, 
By schisms rent asunder, 
By heresies distressed, 
Yet saints their watch are keeping; 
Their cry goes up, "How long?" 
And soon the night of weeping 
Shall be the morn of song. 
</p><p class="stanza">
4.	Mid toil and tribulation, 
And tumult of her war, 
She waits the consummation 
Of peace for evermore; 
Till with the vision glorious, 
Her longing eyes are blest, 
And the great church victorious 
Shall be the church at rest. 
</p><p class="stanza">
5. Yet she on earth hath union 
With God the Three in One, 
And mystic sweet communion 
With those whose rest is won. 
O happy ones and holy! 
Lord, give us grace that we,
Like them, the meek and lowly, 
On high may dwell with thee.
