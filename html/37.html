1. Christ our Redeemer died on the cross,
Died for the sinner, paid all his due.
All who receive Him need never fear,
Yes, He will pass, will pass over you.

When I see the blood,
When I see the blood,
When I see the blood,
I will pass, I will pass
over you.

2. Chiefest of sinners, Jesus will save;
As He has promised, so will He do;
Oh, sinner, hear Him, trust in His Word,
Then He will pass, will pass over you.
</p><p class="chorus">
When I see the blood,
When I see the blood,
When I see the blood,
I will pass, I will pass
over you.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Judgement is coming, all will be there.
Who have rejected, who have refused;
Oh, sinner, hasten, let Jesus in,
Then God will pass, will pass over you.
</p><p class="chorus">
When I see the blood,
When I see the blood,
When I see the blood,
I will pass, I will pass
over you.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Oh, what compassion, oh, boundless love!
Jesus hath power, Jesus is true;
All who believe are safe from the storm,
Oh, He will pass, will pass over you.
</p><p class="chorus">
When I see the blood,
When I see the blood,
When I see the blood,
I will pass, I will pass
over you.
