1. When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, 
and time shall be no more,
And the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair;
When the saved of earth shall gather over on the 
other shore,
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.	
 </p><p class="chorus">
When the roll... is called up yon...der,
When the roll.....is called up yon...der,
When the roll... is called up yon...der,
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be
there.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. On that bright and cloudless morning 
When the dead in Christ shall rise,
And the glory of His resurrection share;
When His chosen ones shall gather to their
home beyond the skies,
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.
 </p><p class="chorus">
When the roll... is called up yon...der,
When the roll.....is called up yon...der,
When the roll... is called up yon...der,
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be
there.
</p><p class="stanza">
3.	Let us labour for the Master from the dawn till setting sun,
Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care;
Then when all of life is over, and our work on earth is done,
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.
 </p><p class="chorus">
When the roll... is called up yon...der,
When the roll.....is called up yon...der,
When the roll... is called up yon...der,
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be
there.
