1. There's no one like my Saviour;
No friend can be like Him;
My never failing sunshine
When earthly lights grow dim;
When summer flow'rs are blooming,
The brightness of my joy,
O, may His happy service
My heart and life employ.
 </p><p class="chorus">
No one, no one like my precious Saviour,
No one, no one such a friend can be;
No one, no one like my precious Saviour,
Glory, glory, Jesus cares for me.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. There's no one like my Saviour;
In seasons of distress,
He draws me closer to Him,
To comfort and to bless;
He gives me in temptation,
The strength of His right arm;
His angels camp around me,
To keep me from all harm.
</p><p class="chorus">
No one, no one like my precious Saviour,
No one, no one such a friend can be;
No one, no one like my precious Saviour,
Glory, glory, Jesus cares for me.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. There's no one like my Saviour;
He pardons all my sin,
And gives His Holy Spirit,
A springing well within;
He leads me out to service,
With gentle touch and mild;
O, wonder of all wonders, 
That I should be His child.
</p><p class="chorus">
No one, no one like my precious Saviour,
No one, no one such a friend can be;
No one, no one like my precious Saviour,
Glory, glory, Jesus cares for me.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. There's no one like my Saviour, 
Come now, and find it true!
He gave His life a ransom,
His blood was shed for you;
Then when we reach the city of everlasting light,
We'll sing with saints and angels,
All honour, power and might.
</p><p class="chorus">
No one, no one like my precious Saviour,
No one, no one such a friend can be;
No one, no one like my precious Saviour,
Glory, glory, Jesus cares for me.
