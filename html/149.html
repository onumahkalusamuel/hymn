1. Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long;
While there are others living about us,
Never molested tho' in the wrong.
</p><p class="chorus">
Farther along we'll know all about it.
Farther along we'll understand why;
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. When death has come and taken our loved ones
Leaving our homes so lonely and drear;
Then do we wonder how others prosper
Living so wicked year after year.
</p><p class="chorus">
Farther along we'll know all about it.
Farther along we'll understand why;
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Faithful till death said our loving Master,
A few more days to labour and wait;
Toils of the road will then be as nothing,
As we sweep through the beautiful gate.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Farther along we'll know all about it.
Farther along we'll understand why;
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. When we see Jesus coming in glory;
When He comes from His home in the sky;
Then we shall meet Him in that bright mansion.
We'll understand it all by and by.
</p><p class="chorus">
Farther along we'll know all about it.
Farther along we'll understand why;
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by.
