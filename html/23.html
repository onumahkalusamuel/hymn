1. My faith has found a resting place,
Not in device nor creed;
I trust the Ever living One;
His wounds for me shall plead.
</p><p class="chorus">
I need no other argument,
I need no other plea;
It is enough that Jesus died,
And that He died for me.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Enough for me that Jesus saves,
This ends my fear and doubt;
A sinful soul I come to Him,
He'll never cast me out.
</p><p class="chorus">
I need no other argument,
I need no other plea;
It is enough that Jesus died,
And that He died for me.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. My heart is leaning on the Word,
The written Word of God,
Salvation by my Saviour's name,
Salvation through His blood.
</p><p class="chorus">
I need no other argument,
I need no other plea;
It is enough that Jesus died,
And that He died for me.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. My great Physician heals the sick,
The lost He came to save;
For me His precious blood He shed,
For me His life He gave.
</p><p class="chorus">
I need no other argument,
I need no other plea;
It is enough that Jesus died,
And that He died for me.
