1. I gave My life for thee,
My precious blood I shed,
That thou might'st ransomed be
And quickened from the dead.
I gave, I gave My life for thee;
What hast thou given for Me?
</p><p class="stanza">
2. I spent long years for thee
In weariness and woe
That an eternity
Of joy thou mightest know.
I spent, I spent long years for thee;
Hast thou spent one for Me?
</p><p class="stanza">
3. My Father's home of light,
My glory-circled throne,
I left for earthly night,
For wanderings sad and lone.
I left, I left it all for thee;
Hast thou left aught for Me?
</p><p class="stanza">
4. I suffered much for thee,
More than My tongue may tell,
Of bitterest agony,
To rescue thee from hell.
I've borne, I've borne it all for thee;
What hast thou borne for me?
</p><p class="stanza">
5. Lord, let my life be given, 
And every moment spent, 
For God, for souls, for heaven,
And all earth's ties be rent
Thou gav'st, Thou gav'st Thyself for me, 
Now I give all for Thee.
