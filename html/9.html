1. "Great is thy faithfulness," O God my father!
There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not
As Thou hast been Thou for ever wilt be.
</p><p class="chorus">
"Great is thy faithfulness!
Great is thy faithfulness!"
Morning by morning new mercies I see,
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided -
"Great is thy faithfulness, " Lord, unto me!
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Summer and winter, and spring time and harvest,
Sun, moon and stars in their courses above,
Join with all nature in manifold witness,
To thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.
</p><p class="chorus">
"Great is thy faithfulness!
Great is thy faithfulness!"
Morning by morning new mercies I see,
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided -
"Great is thy faithfulness, " Lord, unto me!
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide;
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,
Blessings all mine, with ten thousands beside!
</p><p class="chorus">
"Great is thy faithfulness!
Great is thy faithfulness!"
Morning by morning new mercies I see,
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided -
"Great is thy faithfulness, " Lord, unto me!
