1. O soul, are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There's light for a look at the Saviour,
And life more abundant and free!        
</p><p class="chorus">
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face,
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Thro' death into life everlasting
He passed, and we follow Him there;
Over us sin no more hath dominion
For more than conq'rors we are!
</p><p class="chorus">
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face,
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. His Word shall not fail you - He promised;
Believe Him, and all will be well:
Then go to a world that is dying,
His perfect salvation to tell!
</p><p class="chorus">
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face,
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.
