1. Thou hidden source of calm repose,
Thou all sufficient love divine;
My help and refuge from my foes,
Secure I am if Thou art mine,
From sin and grief, from guilt and shame
I hide me, Jesus, in Thy Name.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Thy mighty Name salvation is,
And keeps my happy soul above;
Comfort it brings, and power and peace,
And joy and everlasting love;
To me with Thy dear Name are given
Pardon and holiness and Heaven.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Jesus, my all in all Thou art,
My rest in toil, my ease in pain;
The healing of my broken heart;
In war my peace, in loss my gain:
My smile beneath the tyrant's frown;
In shame my glory and my crown.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. In want my plentiful supply,
In weakness my almighty power;
In bonds my perfect liberty,
My light in Satan's darkest hour,
In grief my joy unspeakable;
My life in death; my heaven, my all..
