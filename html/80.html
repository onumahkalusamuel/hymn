1. Alas! and did my Saviour bleed?
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?  
</p><p class="chorus">
At the cross, at the cross where
I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Was it for crimes that I had done
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!
</p><p class="chorus">
At the cross, at the cross where
I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!
</p><p class="stanza">
3.	Well might the sun in darkness hide,
And shut his glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
For man the creature's sin.
</p><p class="chorus">
At the cross, at the cross where
I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!
</p><p class="stanza">
4. But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe:
Here, Lord, I gave myself away,
'Tis all that I can do.
</p><p class="chorus">
At the cross, at the cross where
I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!
