1. Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Before our Father's throne,
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one, 
Our comforts and our cares.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. We share our mutual woes, 
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. When we asunder part, 
It gives us inward pain:
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again.
