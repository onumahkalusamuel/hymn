1. In the harvest field now ripened
There's a work for all to do;
Hark! the voice of God is calling,
To the harvest calling you.
</p><p class="chorus">
Little is much when God is in it!
Labour not for wealth or fame.
There's a crown and you can win it,
If  you go in Jesus' Name.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Does the place you're called to labour
Seem too small and little known?
It is great if God is in it,
And He'll not forget His own.
</p><p class="chorus">
Little is much when God is in it!
Labour not for wealth or fame.
There's a crown and you can win it,
If  you go in Jesus' Name.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Are you laid aside from service,
Body worn from toil and care?
You can still be in the battle,
In the sacred place of pray'r.
</p><p class="chorus">
Little is much when God is in it!
Labour not for wealth or fame.
There's a crown and you can win it,
If  you go in Jesus' Name.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. When the conflict here is ended
And our race on earth is run,
He will say, if we are faithful,
"Welcome home, my child, well done"
</p><p class="chorus">
Little is much when God is in it!
Labour not for wealth or fame.
There's a crown and you can win it,
If  you go in Jesus' Name.
