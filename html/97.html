1. Oft in danger, oft in woe,
Onward, Christian, onward go:
Fight the fight,  maintain the strife,
Strengthened with the Bread of Life.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Shrink not, Christians: will ye yield?
Will ye quit the painful field?
Will ye flee in danger's hour?
Know ye not your Captain's power?
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Let your drooping hearts be glad:
March in heavenly armour clad:
Fight, nor think the battle long;
Soon shall victory tune your song.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Let not sorrow dim your eye,
Soon shall every tear be dry;
Let not fears your course impede,
Great your strength, if great your need.
</p><p class="stanza">
5. Onward then in battle move,
More than conquerors ye shall prove;
Though opposed by many a foe,
Christian soldiers, onward go.
