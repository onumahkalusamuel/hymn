1. Once again the Gospel message
From the Saviour you have heard;
Will you heed the invitation?
Will you turn and seek the Lord?
 </p><p class="chorus">
Come believing! come believing!
Come to Jesus! look and live!...
Come believing! come believing!
Come to Jesus! look and live!
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Many summers you have wasted,
Ripen'd harvests you have seen;
Winter snows by spring have melted,
Yet you linger in your sin.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Come believing! come believing!
Come to Jesus! look and live!...
Come believing! come believing!
Come to Jesus! look and live!
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Jesus for your choice is waiting;
Tarry not: at once decide!
While the Spirit now is striving,
Yield, and seek the Saviour's side.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Come believing! come believing!
Come to Jesus! look and live!...
Come believing! come believing!
Come to Jesus! look and live!
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Cease of fitness to be thinking;
Do not longer try to feel!
It is trusting, and not feeling,
That will give the Spirit's seal.
  </p><p class="chorus">
Come believing! come believing!
Come to Jesus! look and live!...
Come believing! come believing!
Come to Jesus! look and live!
</p><p class="stanza">
5.	Let your will to God be given,
Trust in Christ's atoning blood;
Look to Jesus now in Heaven,
Rest on His unchanging Word.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Come believing! come believing!
Come to Jesus! look and live!...
Come believing! come believing!
Come to Jesus! look and live!
