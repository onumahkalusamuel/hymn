1. Jesus is the same forever, 
As of old, so now today;
All the hosts of hell endeavour
Vainly to obstruct His sway.
In His people's hearts He reigneth,
Finishes what He begins;
Jesus still "all power" retaineth, 
Saves His people from their sins.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Jesus is the same for ever;
Yes, He heals the sick to-day.
As of old, so now, He never
He can cure the worst diseases,
For He understands our frame;
Bore our griefs, and so releases
All who dare their rights to claim.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Jesus is the same for ever;
Still he says "In Me abide."
From His love no power can sever
Those who in their Lord confide,
Sweetly from all care He frees us,
Ours the comfort -His the shame,
Blessed Saviour; precious Jesus
There's no music like Thy name.
