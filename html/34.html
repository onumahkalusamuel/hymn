1. There's a peace in my heart that the world never gave,
A peace it cannot take away;
Though the trials of life may surround like a cloud,
I've a peace that has come here to stay!
</p><p class="chorus">
Con....stantly abid...ing,
Je...sus is mine;...
Con....stantly abid...ing,
rapture divine;
He never leaves me lonely,
whispers, O so kind-
"I will never leave thee,"
Jesus is mine.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. All the world seemed to sing of a Saviour and King,
When peace sweetly came to my heart;
Troubles all fled away and my night turned to day,
Blessed Jesus, how glorious Thou art!
</p><p class="chorus">
Con....stantly abid...ing,
Je...sus is mine;...
Con....stantly abid...ing,
rapture divine;
He never leaves me lonely,
whispers, O so kind-
"I will never leave thee,"
Jesus is mine.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. This treasure I have in a temple of clay,
While here on His footstool I roam;
But He's coming to take me some glorious day,
Over there to my heavenly home!
</p><p class="chorus">
Con....stantly abid...ing,
Je...sus is mine;...
Con....stantly abid...ing,
rapture divine;
He never leaves me lonely,
whispers, O so kind-
"I will never leave thee,"
Jesus is mine.
