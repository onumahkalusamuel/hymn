1. One there is above all others,
Well deserves the name of Friend;
His is love beyond a brother's,
Costly, free, and knows no end:
They who once His kindness prove,
Find it everlasting love.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Which of all our friends to save us,
Could or would have shed their blood?
But our Jesus died to have us
Reconciled in Him to God:
This was boundless love indeed!
Jesus is a Friend in need.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. When He lived on earth abased
"Friend of sinners" was His name;
Now above all glory raised,
He rejoices in the same;
Still He calls them brethren, friends,
And to all their wants attends.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. O for grace our hearts to soften!
Teach us, Lord, at length to love;
We, alas! forget too often,
What a Friend we have above:
But when home our souls are brought,
We shall love Thee as we ought.
