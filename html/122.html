1. Out in the darkness of sorrow and sin,
Somebody needs your love;
Led by the Master, that soul you may win,
Somebody needs your love.

Somebody needs your love,
Somebody needs your love,...
Someone in sadness,
Yearning for gladness,
Somebody needs your love.

2. Many are helpless, and wait for your call,
Somebody needs your love,
Show them that Jesus is all in all,
Somebody needs your love.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Somebody needs your love,
Somebody needs your love,...
Someone in sadness,
Yearning for gladness,
Somebody needs your love.

3. Someone is tempted to turn from the right,
Somebody needs your love,
Longing for courage and strength for the fight,
Somebody needs your love.
</p><p class="chorus">
Somebody needs your love,
Somebody needs your love,...
Someone in sadness,
Yearning for gladness,
Somebody needs your love.

4. Some are downhearted in sorrow they roam,
Somebody needs your love,
Many are sighing for heaven and home,
Somebody needs your love.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Somebody needs your love,
Somebody needs your love,...
Someone in sadness,
Yearning for gladness,
Somebody needs your love.
