1. If to Christ our only King
Men redeemed we strive to bring,
Just one way this may be done -
We must win them one by one.
 </p><p class="chorus">
So you bring the one next to you,
And I'll bring the one next to me;
In all kinds of weather,
We'll all work together,
And see what can be done.
If you'll bring the one next to you,
And I bring the one next to me,
In no time at all we'll have them all,
So win them, win them, one by one.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Side by side we stand each day,
Saved are we, but lost are they;
They will come if we but dare
Speak a word backed up by prayer.
</p><p class="chorus">
So you bring the one next to you,
And I'll bring the one next to me;
In all kinds of weather,
We'll all work together,
And see what can be done.
If you'll bring the one next to you,
And I bring the one next to me,
In no time at all we'll have them all,
So win them, win them, one by one.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Only cowards dare refuse,
Dare this gift of God mis-use;
Ere some friend goes to his grave,
Speak a word his soul to save.
</p><p class="chorus">
So you bring the one next to you,
And I'll bring the one next to me;
In all kinds of weather,
We'll all work together,
And see what can be done.
If you'll bring the one next to you,
And I bring the one next to me,
In no time at all we'll have them all,
So win them, win them, one by one.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Not for hope of great reward
Turn men's hearts unto the Lord;
Just to see a saved man smile
Makes the effort well worthwhile.
</p><p class="chorus">
So you bring the one next to you,
And I'll bring the one next to me;
In all kinds of weather,
We'll all work together,
And see what can be done.
If you'll bring the one next to you,
And I bring the one next to me,
In no time at all we'll have them all,
So win them, win them, one by one.
