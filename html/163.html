1. My God, is any hour so sweet,
From blush of morn to evening star,
As that which calls me to Thy feet,
The hour of prayer?
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Blest be that tranquil hour of morn,
And blest that hour of solemn eve,
When, on the wings of prayer upborne,
The world I leave.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. For then a day-spring shines on me, 
Brighter than morn's ethereal glow;
And richer dews descend from Thee
Than earth can know.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Then is my strength by Thee renewed;
Then are my sins by Thee forgiven;
Then dost Thou cheer my solitude
With hopes of heaven
</p><p class="stanza">
5. No word can tell what blest relief
There for my every want I find;
What strength for warfare, balm for grief,
What peace of mind.
</p><p class="stanza">
6. Hushed is each doubt, gone every fear;
My spirit seems in heaven to stay;
And even the penitential tear
Is wiped away.
</p><p class="stanza">
7. Lord, till I reach yon blissful shore,
No privilege so dear shall be
As thus my inmost soul to pour
In prayer to Thee.
