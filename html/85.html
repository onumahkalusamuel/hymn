1. Give of your best to the Master;
Give of the strength of your youth;
Throw your soul's fresh, glowing ardoUr
Into the battle for truth.
Jesus has set the example;
Dauntless was He, young and brave;
Give Him your loyal devotion,
Give Him the best that you have.
</p><p class="chorus">
Give of your best to the Master;
Give of the strength of your youth;
Clad in salvation's full armour,
Join in the battle for truth.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Give of your best to the Master;
Give Him first place in your heart;
Give Him first place in your service,
Consecrate ev'ry part.
Give, and to you will be given;
God His beloved Son gave.
Gratefully seeking to serve Him,
Give Him the best that you have.
</p><p class="chorus">
Give of your best to the Master;
Give of the strength of your youth;
Clad in salvation's full armour,
Join in the battle for truth.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Give of your best to the Master;
Naught else is worthy His love.
He gave Himself for your ransom,
Gave up His glory above.
Laid down His life without murmur,
You from sin's ruin to save;
Give Him your heart's adoration,
Give Him the best that you have.
</p><p class="chorus">
Give of your best to the Master;
Give of the strength of your youth;
Clad in salvation's full armour,
Join in the battle for truth.
