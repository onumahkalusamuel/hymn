1. There is One loved me so that
for me he died,
He's my dear, precious Saviour so true;
On the cross for my sins He was crucified;
I want to see Jesus, don't you?
</p><p class="chorus">
I want to see Jesus, don't you?
My Saviour so faithful and true;...
When I reach the strand of that love-bright land,
O I want to see Jesus, don't you?...
</p><p class="stanza">
2. When I'm weary and faint He is 
always near,
With his joy He my strength doth renew;
And He comforts my heart, speaking words of cheer:
I want to see Jesus, don't you?
</p><p class="chorus">
I want to see Jesus, don't you?
My Saviour so faithful and true;...
When I reach the strand of that love-bright land,
O I want to see Jesus, don't you?...
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Holy angels keep watch o'er me 
thro' the night, 
And each morning He guards me anew;
In the smile of His love doth my soul delight;
I want to see Jesus, don't you?
</p><p class="chorus">
I want to see Jesus, don't you?
My Saviour so faithful and true;...
When I reach the strand of that love-bright land,
O I want to see Jesus, don't you?...
</p><p class="stanza">
4. He is fairer than lily or rose to me,
And His blessings fall soft as the dew;
O my heart, how it longs His dear face to see:
I want to see Jesus, don't you?
</p><p class="chorus">
I want to see Jesus, don't you?
My Saviour so faithful and true;...
When I reach the strand of that love-bright land,
O I want to see Jesus, don't you?...
</p><p class="stanza">
5. There's a place for my soul that 
He doth prepare,
And its beauty by faith I can view;
First of all, when I enter that mansion fair, 
I want to see Jesus, don't you?
</p><p class="chorus">
I want to see Jesus, don't you?
My Saviour so faithful and true;...
When I reach the strand of that love-bright land,
O I want to see Jesus, don't you?...
