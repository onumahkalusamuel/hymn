1. There's a land of peace and plenty, 
and its gates are open wide; 
And the pure in heart and 
holy in its shelter may abide,
It is not thro' gates of glory
that a soul must enter in;
But all who  would find entrance 
there must leave the ways of sin.
</p><p class="chorus">
Come over, come over,
to the land of corn and wine,
There is nothing can compare with the many
 holy pleasures there,
Come over, come over, leave the
desert plain below and come away,
Away, come o. . . ver.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. There is bread of heaven in growing, 
in its fair and fertile fields,
And the wine of love its
vineyard to the thirsting mortal yields;
There are mountain heights of
glory that await the trav'lers rod,
And blest retreats where
empty souls draw nearer unto God.
</p><p class="chorus">
Come over, come over,
to the land of corn and wine,
There is nothing can compare with the many
 holy pleasures there,
Come over, come over, leave the
desert plain below and come away,
Away, come o. . . ver.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Who would stay without its borders, 
in the desert dark and drear,
When the lucious grapes of 
eschol, are so very, very, near?
Enter in then with rejoicing, 
for the Lord is on your side,
And in His glorious presence,
ever more you shall abide.
</p><p class="chorus">
Come over, come over,
to the land of corn and wine,
There is nothing can compare with the many
 holy pleasures there,
Come over, come over, leave the
desert plain below and come away,
Away, come o. . . ver.
