1. O Lord! how happy should we be,
If we could leave our care on Thee,
If we from self could rest;
And feel at heart that One above,
In perfect wisdom, perfect love
Is working for the best.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. How far from this our daily life,
Ever disturbed by anxious strife,
By sudden wild alarms.
O could we but relinquish all
Our earthly props, and simply fall
On Thine almighty arms.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Could we but kneel and cast our care
E'en while we pray, upon our God,
Then rise with lightened cheer,
Sure that our Father, who is nigh,
To still the famished raven's cry,
Will hear, in that we fear.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Lord, make these faithless hearts of ours
Such lessons learn from birds and flowers,
And learn from self to cease;
Leave all things to a Father's will,
And taste, before Him lying still
E'en in affliction, peace!
