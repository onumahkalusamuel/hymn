1. More love to Thee, O Christ,
More love to Thee!
Hear Thou the prayer I make
On bended knee;
This is my earnest plea: 
More love, O Christ, to Thee;
More love to Thee, 
More love to Thee!
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Once earthly joy I craved, 
Sought peace and rest;
Now Thee alone I seek, 
Give what is best.
This all my prayer shall be: 
More love, O Christ to Thee;
More love to Thee, 
More love to Thee!
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Then shall my latest breath
Whisper Thy praise;
This be the parting cry 
My heart shall raise;
This still its prayer shall be:
More love, O Christ to Thee,
More love to Thee, 
More love to Thee!
