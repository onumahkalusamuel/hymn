1. The Shepherd of Love is seeking the lost
In paths that are rough and steep;
He's calling the lambs that have gone astray,
He's calling, calling His sheep.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Out of your darkness of sin and shame,
Into His love, forever the same,
Come to Him now, believe on His Name,
O answer the call today.

2. The Shepherd of Love knows His sheep by name,
And tenderly leads the way;
O weary one, come to the Shepherd's fold,
He's calling, calling today.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Out of your darkness of sin and shame,
Into His love, forever the same,
Come to Him now, believe on His Name,
O answer the call today.

3. The Shepherd of Love our ransom hath paid,
And offers salvation free;
He's patiently waiting for thee to come,
He's calling, calling for thee.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Out of your darkness of sin and shame,
Into His love, forever the same,
Come to Him now, believe on His Name,
O answer the call today.

4. The Shepherd of Love now seeketh His sheep,
He seeketh whate'er the cost;
Behold, He is calling the wand'rer home,
He's calling, calling the lost.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Out of your darkness of sin and shame,
Into His love, forever the same,
Come to Him now, believe on His Name,
O answer the call today.
