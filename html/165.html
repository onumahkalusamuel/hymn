1. Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,
Pilgrim through this barren land.
I am weak, but Thou art mighty;
Hold me with Thy powerful hand.
Bread of Heaven!(2ce)
Feed me now and ever more(2ce)
</p><p class="stanza">
2.	Open now the crystal fountain,
Whence the healing stream doth flow;
Let the fire and cloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey through.
Strong Deliverer!(2ce)
Be Thou still my Strength and Shield.(2ce)
</p><p class="stanza">
3. If I tread the verge of Jordan, 
Bid my anxious fears subside:
Bear me through the swelling torrent,
Land me safe on Canaan's side:
Songs of praises!(2ce)
I will ever give to Thee.(2ce)
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Saviour, come! we long to see Thee,
Long to dwell with Thee above;
And to know in full communion,
All the sweetness of Thy love.
Come, Lord Jesus! (2ce)
Take Thy waiting people home. (2ce)
