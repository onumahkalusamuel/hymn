1. I shall see the King
Where the angels sing,
I shall see the King some day,
In the better land,
On the golden strand,
And with Him shall ever stay.	
</p><p class="chorus">
In His glory, I shall see the King,
And forever endless praises sing;
'Twas on Calvary Jesus died for me;
I shall see the King some day.

2. In the land of song,
In the glory throng,
Where there never comes a night,
With my Lord once slain
I shall ever reign
In the glory-land of light
</p><p class="chorus">
In His glory, I shall see the King,
And forever endless praises sing;
'Twas on Calvary Jesus died for me;
I shall see the King some day.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. I shall see the King,
All my tributes bring,
And shall look upon His face;
Then my song shall be
How He ransomed me
And has kept me by His grace.
</p><p class="chorus">
In His glory, I shall see the King,
And forever endless praises sing;
'Twas on Calvary Jesus died for me;
I shall see the King some day.
