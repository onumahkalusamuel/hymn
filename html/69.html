2. Christ on my right hand, Christ on my left hand, 
Christ all around me - Shield in strife; 
Christ in my sleeping, Christ in my sitting, 
Christ in my rising - Light of my life.

3. Christ be in all hearts thinking about me, 
Christ be in all tongues telling of me; 
Christ be the vision in eyes that see me, 
In ears that hear me Christ ever be.
