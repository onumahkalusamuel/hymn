1. From ev'ry stormy wind that blows,
From ev'ry swell-ing tide of woes,
There is a calm, a sure retreat;
'Tis found beneath the mercy seat.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. There is a place where Jesus sheds
The oil of gladness on our heads,
A place than all beside more sweet;
It is the blood-stained mercy seat.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. There is a spot where spirits blend,
And friend holds fellowship with friend;
Though sundered far, by faith we meet
Around one common mercy seat.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Here, there on eagle wing we soar,
And time and sense seem all no more;
And heaven comes down our souls to greet,
And glory crowns the mercy seat.
