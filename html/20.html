1. "I am the Way".the Saviour said,
And I would follow on,
Content to know that after night
Shall break a glorious dawn.
</p><p class="chorus">
"I am the Way, the Truth and the life,
No man cometh unto the Father but by me",
"I am the Way, the Truth and the Life,
No man cometh unto the Father but by me".

2."I am the Truth," then Truth shall be,
A beacon light to guide.
My bark across the Stormy Sea
To where still waters glide.
</p><p class="chorus">
"I am the Way, the Truth and the life,
No man cometh unto the Father but by me",
"I am the Way, the Truth and the Life,
No man cometh unto the Father but by me".
</p><p class="stanza">
3. "I am the Life," there is no death,
For me to fear, nor dread,
Since by His all atoning blood,
My life to His is wed.     
</p><p class="chorus">
"I am the Way, the Truth and the life,
No man cometh unto the Father but by me",
"I am the Way, the Truth and the Life,
No man cometh unto the Father but by me".
