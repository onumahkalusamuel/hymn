1. Jesus, all-atoning Lamb,
Thine, and only thine, I am:
Take my body, spirit, soul;
Only thou possess the whole.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Thou my one thing needful be;
Let me ever cleave to Thee;
Let me choose the better part;
Let me give Thee all my heart.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Fairer than the sons of men,
Do not let me turn again,
Leave the fountain-head of bliss,
Stoop to creature-happiness.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Whom have I on earth below?
Thee, and only Thee, I know;
Whom have I in heaven but Thee?
Thou art all in all to me.
</p><p class="stanza">
5. All my treasure is above,
All my riches is Thy love:
Who the worth of love can tell?
Infinite, unsearchable.
