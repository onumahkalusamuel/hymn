1. God has shown His loving face
From His throne in heav'n above:
And I've found a resting-place, 
In the shelter of His love.
</p><p class="chorus">
I am resting, resting,
Resting sweetly resting in His love;
I am resting in His love,
Resting in the shelter of His love.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. When the cares of life oppress, 
When the sky is dark above;
I can always find a rest,
In the shelter of His love.
</p><p class="chorus">
I am resting, resting,
Resting sweetly resting in His love;
I am resting in His love,
Resting in the shelter of His love.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. O, if you were never blest, 
With this peace from heav'n above;
There's for you a wondrous rest,
In the shelter of His love.
</p><p class="chorus">
I am resting, resting,
Resting sweetly resting in His love;
I am resting in His love,
Resting in the shelter of His love.
