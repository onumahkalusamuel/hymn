1. Saviour, like a shepherd lead us, 
Much we need Thy tender care;
In Thy pleasant pastures feed us, 
For our use Thy folds prepare.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus! 
Thou hast bought us, Thine we are.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus! 
Thou hast bought us, Thine we are.

2. We are Thine, do thou befriend us,
Be the guardian of our way;
Keep Thy flock, from sin defend us, 
Seek us when we go astray.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus!
Hear, O hear us when we pray.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus! 
Hear, O hear us when we pray.

3. Thou hast promised to receive us,
Poor and sinful tho' we be;
Thou hast mercy to relieve us, 
Grace to cleanse and pow'r to free.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus! 
Early let us turn to Thee.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus! 
Early let us turn to Thee.

4. Early let us seek Thy favour, 
Early let us do Thy will;
Blessed Lord and only Saviour, 
With Thy love our bossoms fill.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus! 
Thou hast loved us, love us still.
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus!
Thou hast loved us, love us still.

5. Like a shepherd come receive us,
When Thou comest in the air,
In Thine arms wilt Thou now take us
To that joyful union there:
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
In that land beyond compare;
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
In that land beyond compare.
