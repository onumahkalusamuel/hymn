1. O Love that wilt not let me go,
I rest my weary soul in thee;
I give thee back the life I owe,
That in Thine ocean depths its flow
May richer, fuller be.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. O light that follow'st all my way,
I yield my flick'ring torch to thee;
My heart restores its borrow'd ray,
That in thy sunshine's blaze its day
May brighter, fairer be.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. O Joy that seekest me through pain,
I cannot close my heart to Thee;
I trace the rainbow through the rain,
And feel the promise is not vain,
That morn shall tearless be.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. O Cross that liftest up my head,
I dare not ask to fly from Yhee;
I lay in dust life's glory dead,
And from the ground there blossoms red
Life that shall endless be.
