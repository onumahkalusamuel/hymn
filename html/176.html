1. It may be at morn, when the day is awaking,
When sunlight thro' darkness and shadow is breaking
That Jesus will come in the fullness of glory
To receive from the world "His own."
  </p><p class="chorus">
O Lord Jesus, how long, how long
Ere we shout the glad song,
Christ returneth!  Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!  Amen.  Hallelujah!  Amen.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. It may be at mid-day, it may be at twilight,
It may be, per chance, that the blackness of midnight
Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory,
When Jesus receives "His own."
 </p><p class="chorus">
O Lord Jesus, how long, how long
Ere we shout the glad song,
Christ returneth!  Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!  Amen.  Hallelujah!  Amen.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. While its hosts cry Hosanna, from heaven descending,
With glorified saints and the angels attending, 
With grace on His brow, like a halo of glory, 
Will Jesus receives "His own."
 </p><p class="chorus">
O Lord Jesus, how long, how long
Ere we shout the glad song,
Christ returneth!  Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!  Amen.  Hallelujah!  Amen.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Oh, joy!  oh, delight!  should we go without dying,
No sickness, no sadness, no dread and no crying.
Caught up through the clouds with our Lord into glory,
When Jesus receives His own. 
 </p><p class="chorus">
O Lord Jesus, how long, how long
Ere we shout the glad song,
Christ returneth!  Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!  Amen.  Hallelujah!  Amen.
