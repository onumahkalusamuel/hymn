1. I am bought not with riches,
Neither silver nor gold;
But Christ hath redeemed me,
I am safe in His fold;
In the Book of His kingdom,
With its pages so fair,
Through Jesus my Saviour, 
My name's written there.
</p><p class="chorus">
My name's written there,
On the page white and fair;
In the Book of God's kngdom,
My name's written there.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. My sins, they were many, 
Like the sands of the sea,
But the blood of my Saviour
Is sufficient for me;
For His promise is written, 
In bright letters that glow,
"Tho' your sins be as scarlet,
I will make them like snow".
</p><p class="chorus">
My name's written there,
On the page white and fair;
In the Book of God's kngdom,
My name's written there.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Oh! that beautiful city, 
With its mansions of light,
With its glorified beings,
In pure garments of white;
Where no evil thing cometh
To despoil what is fair;
Where the angels are watching,
My name's written there.
</p><p class="chorus">
My name's written there,
On the page white and fair;
In the Book of God's kngdom,
My name's written there.
