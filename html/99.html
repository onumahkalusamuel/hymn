1. There is vict'ry within my soul
For the spirit with me abides,
Let the waves of temptation roll,
Jesus keeps me whate'er betides,
</p><p class="chorus">
Victory, victory, vict'ry in my soul;
I have glorious victory since Jesus took control,
Victory, victory, sweeping like a flood,
I have glorious victory through Jesus' blood
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Tho' the conflict be fierce and long,
Tho' the tempter my heart assail
In my weakness yet I am strong,
For with Jesus I'll e'er prevail
</p><p class="chorus">
Victory, victory, vict'ry in my soul;
I have glorious victory since Jesus took control,
Victory, victory, sweeping like a flood,
I have glorious victory through Jesus' blood
</p><p class="stanza">
3. I have victory over sin,
I have victory o'er the grave;
Even death now has lost its sting,
Halleluyah I know I'm saved
</p><p class="chorus">
Victory, victory, vict'ry in my soul;
I have glorious victory since Jesus took control,
Victory, victory, sweeping like a flood,
I have glorious victory through Jesus' blood
