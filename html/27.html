1. Storms do not alarm me, they sometime must cease,
Trials cannot harm me, for I have blessed peace;
All I've left behind me, I long for no more,
Better things shall find me on Canaan's shore.
</p><p class="chorus">
Let those who will stay in Egypt land,
I am bound for Canaan,
Where milk and honey flowing,
Shall every need supply;
All battles fought and
the victory won,
Peace and joy my portion,
My soul shall rest on its
shore by and by.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Troubles do not fret me, they cannot abide,
Though they may beset me, in Jesus, I will hide,
All the world's commotion about me may roar,
There's no stormy ocean on Canaan's shore.
</p><p class="chorus">
Let those who will stay in Egypt land,
I am bound for Canaan,
Where milk and honey flowing,
Shall every need supply;
All battles fought and
the victory won,
Peace and joy my portion,
My soul shall rest on its
shore by and by.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. I in grace abiding, am trying to stay,
In the shadow hiding of Canaan's perfect day;
All I trust may fail me, 'twill matter no more,
Nothing can assail me on Canaan's shore.
</p><p class="chorus">
Let those who will stay in Egypt land,
I am bound for Canaan,
Where milk and honey flowing,
Shall every need supply;
All battles fought and
the victory won,
Peace and joy my portion,
My soul shall rest on its
shore by and by.
