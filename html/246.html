1. O brother, life's journey beginning,
With courage and firmness arise!
Look well to the course thou art choosing;
Be earnest, be watchful, and wise!
Remember-two paths are before thee,
And both thy attention invite;
But one leadeth on to destruction,
The other to joy and delight.
</p><p class="chorus">
God help you to follow His banner,
And serve Him wherever you go;
And when you are tempted, my brother,
God give you the grace to say "No!"
</p><p class="stanza">
2. O brother, yield not to the tempter,
No matter what others may do;
Stand firm in the strength of the Master,
Be loyal, be faithful, and true!
Each trial will make you the stronger,
If you, in the name of the Lord,
Fight manfully under your Leader,
Obeying the voice of His Word.
</p><p class="chorus">
God help you to follow His banner,
And serve Him wherever you go;
And when you are tempted, my brother,
God give you the grace to say "No!"
</p><p class="stanza">
3. O brother, the Saviour is calling!
Beware of the danger of sin;
Resist not the voice of the Spirit,
That whispers so gently within.
God calls you to enter His service-
To live for Him here, day by day;
And share by and by in the glory
That never shall vanish away.
</p><p class="chorus">
God help you to follow His banner,
And serve Him wherever you go;
And when you are tempted, my brother,
God give you the grace to say "No!"
