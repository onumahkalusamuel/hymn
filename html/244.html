1. Friends all around me are trying to find
What the heart yearns for, by sin undermined;
I have the secret, I know where 'tis found:
Only true pleasures in Jesus abound.
</p><p class="chorus">
All that I want is in Je...sus.
He satisfies,... joy He supplies;...
Life would be worthless without ... Him,...
All things in Jesus I find.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Some carry burdens whose weight has for years
Crushed them with sorrow and blinded with tears.
Yet One stands ready to help them just now,
If they will humbly in penitence bow.
</p><p class="chorus">
All that I want is in Je...sus.
He satisfies,... joy He supplies;...
Life would be worthless without ... Him,...
All things in Jesus I find.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. No other name thrills the joy-chords within,
And through none else is remission of sin.
He knows the pain of the heart sorely tried.
Both need and want will by Him be supplied.
 </p><p class="chorus">
All that I want is in Je...sus.
He satisfies,... joy He supplies;...
Life would be worthless without ... Him,...
All things in Jesus I find.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Jesus is all this poor world needs today.
Blindly they strive, for sin darkens their way.
O to draw back the grim curtains of night,
One glimpse of Jesus and all will be bright!
</p><p class="chorus">
All that I want is in Je...sus.
He satisfies,... joy He supplies;...
Life would be worthless without ... Him,...
All things in Jesus I find.
