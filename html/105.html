1. I'll tell the world, that I'm a christian,
I'm not ashamed, His name to bear;
I'll tell the world, that I'm a christian,
I'll take Him with me anywhere.
I'll tell the world, how Jesus saved me,
And how He gave me a life brand-new;
And I know that if you trust Him,
That all He gave me, He'll give to you.
I'll tell the world, that He's my Saviour,
No other one, could love me so;
My life, my all is His forever,
And where He leads me I will go.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. I'll tell the world that He is coming-
It may be near or far away;
But we must live as if His coming
Would be tomorrow or today.
For when He comes and life is over, 
For those who love Him there's more to be;
Eyes have never seen the wonders
That He's preparing for you and me.
O tell the world that your're a Christian,
And take Him with you ev'ry where.
