<p class="title">RESCUE THE PERISHING</p>
<p class="stanza">
    1. Rescue the perishing, Care for the dying,
    Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
    Weep o'er the erring one, Lift up the fallen,
    Tell them of Jesus, the Mighty to save.
</p>
<p class="chorus">
    Rescue the perishing,
    Care for the dying,
    Jesus is merciful,
    Jesus will save.
</p>
<p class="stanza">
    2. Though they are slighting Him, Still He is waiting,
    Waiting the penitent child to receive;
    Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;
    He will forgive if they only believe.
</p>
<p class="chorus">
    Rescue the perishing,
    Care for the dying,
    Jesus is merciful,
    Jesus will save.
</p>
<p class="stanza">
    3. Down in the human heart, Crushed by the tempter,
    Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;
    Touched by a loving heart, wakened by kindness,
    Chords that were broken will vibrate once more.
</p>
<p class="chorus">
    Rescue the perishing,
    Care for the dying,
    Jesus is merciful,
    Jesus will save.
</p>
<p class="stanza">
    4. Rescue the perishing, Duty demands it;
    Strength for thy labour the Lord will provide;
    Back to the narrow way patiently win them;
    Tell the poor wanderer a Saviour has died.
</p>
<p class="chorus">
    Rescue the perishing,
    Care for the dying,
    Jesus is merciful,
    Jesus will save.
