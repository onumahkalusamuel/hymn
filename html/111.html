1. Rescue the perishing, Care for the dying,
Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
Weep o'er the erring one, Lift up the fallen,
Tell them of Jesus, the Mighty to save.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying,
Jesus is merciful,
Jesus will save.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Though they are slighting Him, Still He is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive;
Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;
He will forgive if they only believe.
</p><p class="chorus">
Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying,
Jesus is merciful,
Jesus will save.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Down in the human heart, Crushed by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;
Touched by a loving heart, wakened by kindness,
Chords that were broken will vibrate once more.
</p><p class="chorus">
Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying,
Jesus is merciful,
Jesus will save.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Rescue the perishing, Duty demands it;
Strength for thy labour the Lord will provide;
Back to the narrow way patiently win them;
Tell the poor wanderer a Saviour has died.
</p><p class="chorus">
Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying,
Jesus is merciful,
Jesus will save.
