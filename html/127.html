1. Rock of Ages, cleft for me, 
Let me hide myself in thee; 
Let the water and the blood, 
From thy riven side which flowed, 
Be of sin the double cure; 
Cleanse from guiLt and power. </p><p class="stanza">
2. Not the labours of my hands 
Can fulfil thy law's commands; 
Could my zeal no respite know, 
Could my tears forever flow, 
All for sin could not atone; 
Thou must save, and Thou alone. 
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Nothing in my hand I bring, 
Simply to the cross I cling; 
Naked, come to thee for dress; 
Helpless, look to thee for grace; 
Foul, I to the fountain fly; 
Wash me, Saviour, or I die. 
</p><p class="stanza">
4. While I draw this fleeting breath, 
When my eyelids close in death, 
When I soar to worlds unknown, 
See thee on thy judgement throne, 
Rock of Ages, cleft for me, 
Let me hide myself in Thee.
