1. Wonderful love that rescued me, 
Sunk deep in sin,
Guilty and vile as I could be - 
No hope within;
When ev'ry ray of light had fled, 
O glorious day!
Raising my soul from out the dead,
Love found a way.
  </p><p class="chorus">
Love found a way.... to redeem my soul,...
Love found a way... that could make me whole;...
Love sent my Lord ... to the cross of shame,
Love found a way, O praise His holy name!
</p><p class="stanza"> 
2. Love bro't my Saviour here to die
On Calvary,
For such a sinful wretch as I,
How can it be?
Love bridged the gulf 'twixt me and heav'n, 
Taught me to pray;
I am redeemed, set free, forgiv'n, 
Love found a way.
  </p><p class="chorus">
Love found a way.... to redeem my soul,...
Love found a way... that could make me whole;...
Love sent my Lord ... to the cross of shame,
Love found a way, O praise His holy name!
</p><p class="stanza"> 
3. Love opened wide the gates of light 
To heav'n's domain,
Where in eternal power and might 
Jesus shall reign;
Love lifted me from depths of woe 
To endless day,
There was no help in earth below,
Love found a way. 
  </p><p class="chorus">
Love found a way.... to redeem my soul,...
Love found a way... that could make me whole;...
Love sent my Lord ... to the cross of shame,
Love found a way, O praise His holy name!
