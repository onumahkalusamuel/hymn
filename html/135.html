1. Tell me the old, old story,
Of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and His glory,
Of Jesus and His love;
Tell me the story simply, 
As to a little child,
For I am weak and weary,
And helpless and defiled.
</p><p class="chorus">
Tell me the Old, Old Story,
Tell me the Old, Old story,
Tell me the Old, Old story,
Of Jesus and His love.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Tell me the story slowly,
That I may take it in -
That wonderful redemption, 
God's remedy for sin;
Tell me the story often, 
For I forget so soon,
The "early dew" of morning
Has passed away at noon.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Tell me the Old, Old Story,
Tell me the Old, Old story,
Tell me the Old, Old story,
Of Jesus and His love.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Tell me the story softly, 
With earnest tones, and grave;
Remember I'm the sinner 
Whom Jesus came to save;
Tell me the story always, 
If you would really be,
In any time of trouble,
A comforter to me.
</p><p class="chorus">
Tell me the Old, Old Story,
Tell me the Old, Old story,
Tell me the Old, Old story,
Of Jesus and His love.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Tell me the same Old story,
When you have cause to fear
That this world's empty glory
Is costing me too dear;
Yes, and when that world's glory 
Is dawning on my soul,
Tell me the old, old story: 
"Christ Jesus makes thee whole."
 </p><p class="chorus">
Tell me the Old, Old Story,
Tell me the Old, Old story,
Tell me the Old, Old story,
Of Jesus and His love.
