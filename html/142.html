1. There is singing up in Heaven such as we have never known,
Where the angels sing the praises of the Lamb upon the throne;
Their sweet harps are ever tuneful, and their voices always clear,
O that we might be more like them while we serve the Master here!
</p><p class="chorus">
"Holy, holy" is what the angels sing,
And I expect to help them make the courts of
 heaven ring;
But when I sing redemption's story, they will
 fold their wings,
For angels never felt the joys that
 our salvation brings.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. But I hear another anthem, blending voices clear and strong,
"Unto Him who hath redeemed us and hath bought us," is the song;
We have come through tribulation to this land so fair and bright,
In the fountain freely flowing He hath made our garments white.
</p><p class="chorus">
"Holy, holy" is what the angels sing,
And I expect to help them make the courts of
 heaven ring;
But when I sing redemption's story, they will
 fold their wings,
For angels never felt the joys that
 our salvation brings.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Then the angels stand and listen, for they cannot join the song,
Like the sound of many waters, by that happy, blood washed throng;
For they sing about great trials, battles fought and vict'ries won,
And they praise their great Redeemer who hath said to them, "Well done."
</p><p class="chorus">
"Holy, holy" is what the angels sing,
And I expect to help them make the courts of
 heaven ring;
But when I sing redemption's story, they will
 fold their wings,
For angels never felt the joys that
 our salvation brings.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. So, although I'm not an angel, yet I know that over there
I will join a blessed chorus that the angels cannot share;
I will sing about my Saviour, who upon dark Calvary
Freely pardoned my transgression, died to set a sinner free.
</p><p class="chorus">
"Holy, holy" is what the angels sing,
And I expect to help them make the courts of
 heaven ring;
But when I sing redemption's story, they will
 fold their wings,
For angels never felt the joys that
