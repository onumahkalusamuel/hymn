And to take Him at His Word;
Just to rest upon His promise,
And to know, "Thus says the Lord"

Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
How I've proved Him o'er and o'er
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
O for grace to trust Him more!

2. O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to trust His cleansing blood;
Just in simple faith to plunge me
'Neath the healing, cleansing flood!

Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
How I've proved Him o'er and o'er
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
O for grace to trust Him more!

3. Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just from sin and self to cease;
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest, and joy and peace.

Precious Jesus, Saviour, Friend;
And I know that Thou art with me,
Wilt be with me to the end.

How I've proved Him o'er and o'er
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
