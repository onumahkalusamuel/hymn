1. Rejoice in the Lord! oh, let His mercy cheer;
He sunders the bands that enthrall;
Redeem'd by His blood why should we ever fear
Since Jesus is our "all in all"?
</p><p class="chorus">
"If God be for us, if God be for us,
If God be for us, who can be against us?
Who? Who? Who?
Who can be against us, against us?"
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Be strong in the Lord! rejoicing in His might,
Be loyal and true day by day;
When evils assail, be valiant for the right,
And He will be our strength and stay.
</p><p class="chorus">
"If God be for us, if God be for us,
If God be for us, who can be against us?
Who? Who? Who?
Who can be against us, against us?"
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Confide in His Word - His promises so sure;
In Christ they are "yea and amen;"
Though earth pass away, they ever shall endure,
'Tis written o'er and o'er again.
</p><p class="chorus">
"If God be for us, if God be for us,
If God be for us, who can be against us?
Who? Who? Who?
Who can be against us, against us?"
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Abide in the Lord: secure in His control,
'Tis life everlasting begun;
To pluck from His hand the weakest, trembling soul -
It never, never can be done!
</p><p class="chorus">
"If God be for us, if God be for us,
If God be for us, who can be against us?
Who? Who? Who?
Who can be against us, against us?"
