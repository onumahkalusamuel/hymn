1. Go, labour on, spend, and be spent,
Thy joy to do the Father's will:
It is the way the Master went;
Should not the servant tread it still?
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Go, labour on! 'tis not for nought
Thy earthly loss is heav'nly gain;
Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not;
The Master praises, what are men?
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Men die in darkness at thy side,
Without a hope to cheer the tomb;
Take up the torch and wave it wide,
The torch that lights time's thickest gloom.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice,
For toil comes rest, for exile home;
Soon shalt thou hear the Bridegroom's voice,
The midnight peal, "Behold, I come!"
