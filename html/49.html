1. While passing thro' this world of sin,
and others your life shall view,
Be clean and pure without, within;
Let others see Jesus in you.
</p><p class="chorus">
Let others see Jesus in you,.....
Let others see Jesus in you,.....
Keep telling the story, be faithful and true;
Let others see Jesus in you.

2. Your life's a book before their eyes,
They're reading it thro' and thro'
Say, does it point them to the skies,
Do others see Jesus in you?
</p><p class="chorus">
Let others see Jesus in you,.....
Let others see Jesus in you,.....
Keep telling the story, be faithful and true;
Let others see Jesus in you.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. What joy 'twill be at set of sun,
In mansions beyond the blue,
To find some souls that you have won;
Let others see Jesus in you.
</p><p class="chorus">
Let others see Jesus in you,.....
Let others see Jesus in you,.....
Keep telling the story, be faithful and true;
Let others see Jesus in you.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Then live for Christ both day and night,
Be faithful, be brave and true,
and lead the lost to life and Light.
Let others see Jesus in you.
</p><p class="chorus">
Let others see Jesus in you,.....
Let others see Jesus in you,.....
Keep telling the story, be faithful and true;
Let others see Jesus in you.
