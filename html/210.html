1. Open my eyes, that I may see,
Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me;
Place in my hands the wonderful key,
That shall unclasp and set me free.
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready my God, Thy will to see;
Open my eyes illumine me, 
Spirit Divine!
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Open my ears, that I may hear,
Voices of truth Thou sendest clear;
And while the wave notes fall on my ear,
Everything false will disappear.
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready my God, Thy will to see;
Open my eyes illumine me, 
Spirit Divine!
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Open my mouth, and let me bear,
Gladly the warm truth everywhere;
Open my heart, and let me prepare,
Love with Thy children thus to share,
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready my God, Thy will to see;
Open my eyes illumine me, 
Spirit Divine! 
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Open my mind, that I may read
More of thy love in word and deed;
What shall I fear while yet Thou dost lead?
Only for light from Thee I plead,
Silently now I wait for Thee
Ready, my God, Thy will to see
Open my mind, illumine me,
Spirit divine!
</p><p class="stanza">
5. Open my way, that I may bring
Trophies of grace to Thee, my King;
Echoed in love Thy word shall out ring
Sweet as the note that angels sing,
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
Open my way, illumine me,
Spirit Divine!
