1. O do not let the Word depart,
And close thine eyes against the light;
Poor sinner, harden not your heart,
Be saved, O tonight.
</p><p class="chorus">
O why not to-night? O why not to-night?
Wilt thou be saved?
Then why not tonight?
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Tomorrow's sun may never rise,
To bless thy long deluded sight;
This is the time, O then be wise,
Be saved, O tonight.
 </p><p class="chorus">
O why not to-night? O why not to-night?
Wilt thou be saved?
Then why not tonight?
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Our Lord in pity lingers still,
And wilt thou thus His love requite?
Renounce at once thy stubborn will,
Be saved, O tonight.
</p><p class="chorus">
O why not to-night? O why not to-night?
Wilt thou be saved?
Then why not tonight?
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Our blessed Lord refuses none
Who would to Him their souls unite;
Believe, obey the work is done,
Be saved, O tonight.
 </p><p class="chorus">
O why not to-night? O why not to-night?
Wilt thou be saved?
Then why not tonight?
