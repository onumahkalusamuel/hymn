1. Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!
E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me,
Still all my song shall be, 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down,
Darkness be over me, my rest a stone.
Yet in my dreams I'd be 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!
</p><p class="stanza">
3. There let the way appear, steps unto heaven;
All that Thou sendest me, in mercy giv'n;
Angels to beckon me 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Then, with my waking thoughts bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise;
So by my woes to be 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!
</p><p class="stanza">
5. Or, if on joyful wing cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon, and stars forgot, upward I'll fly,
Still all my song shall be, 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!
