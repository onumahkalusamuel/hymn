1. Since the Son hath made me free,
Let me taste my liberty;
Thee behold with open face,
Triumph in thy saving grace,
Thy great will delight to prove,
Glory in thy perfect love.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Abba, Father, hear thy child,
Late in Jesus reconciled;
Hear, and all the graces shower,
All the joy, and peace, and power,
All my Saviour asks above,
All the life and heaven of love. 
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Heavenly Adam, Life divine,
Change my nature into Thine!
Move and spread throughout my soul,
Actuate and fill the whole;
Be it I no longer now
Living in the flesh, but Thou.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Holy Ghost, no more delay
Come, and in thy temple stay!
Now thine inward witness bear,
Strong, and permanent, and clear;
Spring of life, Thyself impart,
Rise eternal in my heart.
Amen.
