1. Impatient heart, be still!
What tho' He tarries long?
What tho' the triumph song
Is still delay'd?
Thou hast His promise sure,
And that is all secure;
Be not afraid! Be not afraid!	
</p><p class="chorus">
Be still! ... be still!
Impatient heart ... be still!
</p><p class="stanza">           
2. My eager heart, be still!
Thy Lord will surely come,
And take thee to His home,
With Him to dwell;
It may not be today;
And yet, my soul, it may;
I cannot tell, I cannot tell.	
</p><p class="chorus">
Be still! ... be still!
Impatient heart ... be still!
</p><p class="stanza">           
3. My anxious heart, be still!
Watch, work, and pray, and then
It will not matter when
Thy Lord shall come;
At midnight, or at noon;
He cannot come too soon
To take thee home, To take thee home.	
</p><p class="chorus">
Be still! ... be still!
Impatient heart ... be still!
