1. Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go;
Anywhere He leads me in this world below;
Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade;
Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.
</p><p class="chorus">
Anywhere, anywhere!
Fear I cannot know;
Anywhere with Jesus
I can safely go.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;
Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;
Tho' His hand may lead me over dreariest ways,
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.
</p><p class="chorus">
Anywhere, anywhere!
Fear I cannot know;
Anywhere with Jesus
I can safely go.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Anywhere with Jesus, over land and sea,
Telling souls in darkness of salvation free;
Ready as He summons me to go or stay,
Anywhere with Jesus when He points the way.
</p><p class="chorus">
Anywhere, anywhere!
Fear I cannot know;
Anywhere with Jesus
I can safely go.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,
When the darkening shadows round about me creep,
Knowing I shall waken, never more to roam;
Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.
</p><p class="chorus">
Anywhere, anywhere!
Fear I cannot know;
Anywhere with Jesus
I can safely go.
