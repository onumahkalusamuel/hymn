1. Christ, our mighty Captain, leads against the foe;
We will never falter when He bids us go;
Tho' His righteous purpose we may never know,
Yet we'll follow all the way.

Forward! forward! 'tis the Lord's command,
Forward! forward! to the promised land;
Forward! forward! let the chorus ring:
We are sure to win with Christ, our King!

2. Satan's fearful onslaughts cannot make us yield;
While we trust in Christ, our Buckler and our Shield;
Pressing ever on - the Spirit's sword we wield,
And we follow all the way.

Forward! forward! 'tis the Lord's command,
Forward! forward! to the promised land;
Forward! forward! let the chorus ring:
We are sure to win with Christ, our King!

3. Let our glorious banner ever be unfurled-
From its mighty stronghold evil shall be hurled;
Christ, our mighty Captain, overcomes the world,
And we follow all the way.

Forward! forward! 'tis the Lord's command,
Forward! forward! to the promised land;
Forward! forward! let the chorus ring:
We are sure to win with Christ, our King!

4. Fierce the battle rages, but 'twill not be long,
Then triumphant - shall we join the blessed throng,
Joyfully uniting in the victor's song-
If we follow all the way.
</p><p class="chorus">
Forward! forward! 'tis the Lord's command,
Forward! forward! to the promised land;
Forward! forward! let the chorus ring:
We are sure to win with Christ, our King!
