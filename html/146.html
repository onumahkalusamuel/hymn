1. Face to face with Christ, my Saviour,
Face to face -what will it be?
When with rapture I behold Him,
Jesus Christ who died for me.
</p><p class="chorus">
Face to face I shall behold Him,
Far beyond the starry sky;
Face to face in all His glory,
I shall see Him by and by!
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Only faintly now, I see Him,
With the darkling veil between,
But a blessed day is coming,
When His glory shall be seen.
</p><p class="chorus">
Face to face I shall behold Him,
Far beyond the starry sky;
Face to face in all His glory,
I shall see Him by and by!
</p><p class="stanza">
3. What rejoicing in His presence,
When are banished grief and pain;
When the crooked ways are straightened,
And the dark things shall be plain.
</p><p class="chorus">
Face to face I shall behold Him,
Far beyond the starry sky;
Face to face in all His glory,
I shall see Him by and by!
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Face to face - O blissful moment!
Face to face to see and know;
Face to face with my Redeemer,
Jesus Christ who loves me so!
</p><p class="chorus">
Face to face I shall behold Him,
Far beyond the starry sky;
Face to face in all His glory,
I shall see Him by and by!
