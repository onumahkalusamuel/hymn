Redeem'd by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeem'd thro' His infinite mercy,
His child, and forever, I am.

No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence
With me doth continually dwell.

I think of Him all the day long;
I sing, for I cannot be silent;
His love is the theme of my song.

The King in whose way I delight;
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
And giveth me songs in the night.

In yonder bright mansion for me;
And soon, with the spirits made perfect,
At home with the Lord I shall be.

Redeem'd, redeem'd,
Redeem'd by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeem', redeem'd,
His child, and forever, I am.
