1. The cross upon which Jesus died
Is a shelter in which we can hide
And its grace so free is sufficient for me
And deep is its fountain as wide as the sea.
 </p><p class="chorus">
There's room at the cross for you
There's room at the cross for you
Though millions have come, there's
still room for one
Yes there's room at the cross for you.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Tho' millions have found him a friend
And have turned from the sins they have sinned
The Saviour still waits to open the gates
And welcome a sinner before it's too late.
 </p><p class="chorus">
There's room at the cross for you
There's room at the cross for you
Though millions have come, there's
still room for one
Yes there's room at the cross for you.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. The hand of my Saviour is strong
And the love of my Saviour is long
Through sunshine or rain, through loss or in gain,
The blood flows from Calv'ry to cleanse ev'ry stain.
 </p><p class="chorus">
There's room at the cross for you
There's room at the cross for you
Though millions have come, there's
still room for one
Yes there's room at the cross for you.
