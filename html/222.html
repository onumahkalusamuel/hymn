1. Speed Thy servants, Saviour, speed them;
Thou art Lord of winds and waves;
They were bound, but Thou hast freed them;
Now they go to free the slaves:
Be Thou with them, 
'Tis Thine arm alone that saves.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Friends, and home, and all forsaking,
Lord they go at Thy command,
As their stay Thy promise taking,
While they traverse sea and land:
O, be with them,
Lead them safely by the hand!
</p><p class="stanza">
3. When no fruit appears to cheer them,
And they seem to toil in vain,
Then in mercy, Lord, draw near them,
Then their sinking hopes sustain:
Thus supported, 
Let their zeal revive again.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. In the midst of opposition
Let them trust, O Lord, in Thee;
When success attends their mission,
Let Thy servants humble be:
Never leave them, 
Till Thy face in heaven they see.
</p><p class="stanza">
5. There to reap in joy forever,
Fruit that grows from seed here sown;
There to be with Him, who never
Ceases to preserve His own;
And with gladness, 
Give the praise to Him alone.
