1. What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought
Since Jesus came into my heart;
I have light in my soul for which long I had sought,
Since Jesus came into my heart.
</p><p class="chorus">
Since Jesus came into my heart,
Since Jesus came into my heart,
Floods of joy o'er my soul
Like the sea billows roll,
Since Jesus came into my heart.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. I have ceased from my wand'ring and going astray,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And my sins, which were many are all washed away,
Since Jesus came into my heart.
</p><p class="chorus">
Since Jesus came into my heart,
Since Jesus came into my heart,
Floods of joy o'er my soul
Like the sea billows roll,
Since Jesus came into my heart.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. I shall go there to dwell in that City, I know,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And I'm happy, so happy as onward I go,
Since Jesus came into my heart.
</p><p class="chorus">
Since Jesus came into my heart,
Since Jesus came into my heart,
Floods of joy o'er my soul
Like the sea billows roll,
Since Jesus came into my heart.
