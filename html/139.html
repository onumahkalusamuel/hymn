1. There is a home eternal,
Beautiful and bright,
Where sweet joys supernal
Never are dimmed by night;
White-rob'd angels are singing
Ever around the bright throne;
When, oh, When shall I see thee,
Beautiful, beautiful Home?
</p><p class="chorus">
Home! beautiful home,
Bright, beautiful home;
Bright home of our Saviour,
Bright, beautiful home.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Flowers forever are springing
In that home so fair;
Thousands of children are singing
Praises to Jesus there;
How they swell the glad anthem
Ever around the bright throne!
When, oh, when shall I see thee,
Beautiful, beautiful Home?
 </p><p class="chorus">
Home! beautiful home,
Bright, beautiful home;
Bright home of our Saviour,
Bright, beautiful home.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Soon shall I join the ransomed,
Far beyond the sky;
Christ is my salvation,
Why should I fear to die?
Soon my eyes will behold Him
Seated upon the bright throne;
Then, oh, then shall I see thee,
Beautiful, beautiful home! 
</p><p class="chorus">
Home! beautiful home,
Bright, beautiful home;
Bright home of our Saviour,
Bright, beautiful home.
