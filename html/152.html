1. Joys are flowing like a river,
Since the Comforter has come;
He abides with us forever,
Makes the trusting heart His home.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Blessed quietness, holy quietness,
What assurance in my soul!
On the stormy sea He speaks peace to me.
How the billows cease to roll.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Bringing life and health and gladness
All around, this heav,nly Guest
Banished unbelief and sadness,
Chang'd our weariness to rest.
</p><p class="chorus">
Blessed quietness, holy quietness,
What assurance in my soul!
On the stormy sea He speaks peace to me.
How the billows cease to roll.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Like the rain that falls from heaven,
Like the sunlight from the sky,
So the Holy Ghost is given,
Coming to us from on high.
</p><p class="chorus">
Blessed quietness, holy quietness,
What assurance in my soul!
On the stormy sea He speaks peace to me.
How the billows cease to roll.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. What a wonderful salvation
Where we always see His face;
What a perfect habitation,
What a quiet resting-place.
</p><p class="chorus">
Blessed quietness, holy quietness,
What assurance in my soul!
On the stormy sea He speaks peace to me.
How the billows cease to roll.
