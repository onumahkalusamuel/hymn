1. Rejoice, the Lord is King! 
Your Lord and King adore; 
Mortals, give thanks and sing, 
And triumph evermore. 
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice; 
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice! 
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Jesus the Saviour reigns, 
The God of truth and love; 
When he had purged our stains, 
He took his seat above. 
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice; 
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice! 
</p><p class="stanza">
3. His kingdom cannot fail; 
He rules o'er earth and heaven; 
The keys of death and hell 
Are to our Saviour given; 
Lift up your heart, 
Lift up your voice; 
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice! 
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Rejoice in glorious hope! 
Jesus the Judge shall come, 
And take his servants up 
To their eternal home. 
We soon shall hear th'archangel's voice; 
The trump of God shall sound, rejoice!
