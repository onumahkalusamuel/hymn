1. Just as God who reigns on High
Spake to men in days gone by,
So the Lord is calling men today;
And, my brother this is true,
Whatsoe'er He says to you
There is but one thing to do -
Just obey
</p><p class="chorus">
Just obey. . ., just obey. . .,
Is the way. . ., God's way. . .,
When His message comes to you,
There is but one thing to do,
Just obey . . ., just obey.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. If you're in the Saviour's hands,
You must do as He commands,
For there is no other gospel way;
Never put the message by,
Never stop to reason why,
When the Saviour speaks to you -
Just obey
</p><p class="chorus">
Just obey. . ., just obey. . .,
Is the way. . ., God's way. . .,
When His message comes to you,
There is but one thing to do,
Just obey . . ., just obey.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. If for mansions fair you sigh
In that land beyond the sky
After time with you has pass'd away;
Tho' the way you may not see,
Christ is calling "Follow Me"
Faith and duty both will cry -
Just obey
</p><p class="chorus">
Just obey. . ., just obey. . .,
Is the way. . ., God's way. . .,
When His message comes to you,
There is but one thing to do,
Just obey . . ., just obey.
