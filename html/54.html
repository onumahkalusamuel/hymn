1. Listen to the Master's pleading,
There is urgent work for all;
Heed the Spirit's interceding,
Give this answer to the call:
</p><p class="chorus">
I am ready for service for Thee, dear Lord,
Here am I, send me,
I am willing to be what you'd have me be,
I will go where you want me to go
I am ready for service for Thee, dear Lord,
Here am I, send me,
Though the pathway seems dark
For Thee I'll do or die,
I am ready for service Lord.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. There's a voice to you now calling,
Will you heed the earnest word?
On the ear it's gently calling,
Give this answer to your Lord:
</p><p class="chorus">
I am ready for service for Thee, dear Lord,
Here am I, send me,
I am willing to be what you'd have me be,
I will go where you want me to go
I am ready for service for Thee, dear Lord,
Here am I, send me,
Though the pathway seems dark
For Thee I'll do or die,
I am ready for service Lord.

3. Many souls in sin are dying;
Haste to help them while you may,
For the time is swiftly flying,
Will you now to Jesus say:
</p><p class="chorus">
I am ready for service for Thee, dear Lord,
Here am I, send me,
I am willing to be what you'd have me be,
I will go where you want me to go
I am ready for service for Thee, dear Lord,
Here am I, send me,
Though the pathway seems dark
For Thee I'll do or die,
I am ready for service Lord.
