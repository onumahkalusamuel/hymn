1. When I come to the river at the ending of day,
When the last winds of sorrow have blown;
There'll be somebody waiting to show me the way,
I won't have to cross Jordan alone.
</p><p class="chorus">
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
Jesus died all my sins to atone
In the darkness I see
He'll be waiting for me
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Often times I'm weary and weary and sad,
When it seems that my friends have all gone;
There is one thought that cheers me and makes my heart glad,
I won't have to cross Jordan alone. 
</p><p class="chorus">
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
Jesus died all my sins to atone
In the darkness I see
He'll be waiting for me
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Tho' the billows of trouble and sorrow may sweep,
Christ the Saviour will care for His own;
Till the end of my journey my soul He will keep,
And I won't have to cross Jordan alone.
</p><p class="chorus">
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
Jesus died all my sins to atone
In the darkness I see
He'll be waiting for me
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
