From Him no pow'r of evil can sever,
He gave His life to ransom my soul;
Now I belong to Him:

Not for the years of time alone,
But for eternity.

Jesus came down to bring me salvation,
Lifted me up from sorrow and shame,
Now I belong to Him;

Jesus belongs to me,
Not for the years of time alone,
But for eternity.

Freed me from sin that long had enslaved me
His precious blood, He gave to redeem,
Now I belong to Him;

Jesus belongs to me,
Not for the years of time alone,
But for eternity.
