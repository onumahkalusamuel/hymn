1. Shackled by a heavy burden,
'Neath a load of guilt and shame;
Then the hand of Jesus touched me,
And now I am no longer the same.
</p><p class="chorus">
He touched me, Oh, He touched me,
And Oh, the joy that floods my soul.
Something happened, and now I know,
He touched me and made me whole.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Since I met this blessed Saviour,
Since He cleansed and made me whole;
I will never cease to praise Him,
I'll shout it while eternity rolls.
</p><p class="chorus">
He touched me, Oh, He touched me,
And Oh, the joy that floods my soul.
Something happened, and now I know,
He touched me and made me whole.
