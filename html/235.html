1. "The Holy Spirit's power
Ye need," the Master said;
"So wait till comes the hour
When on you He is shed."
So praise did all their souls employ
As tarried they with fervent joy.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. And when ten days were passed
With one accord were they, 
Heaven's windows long closed fast, 
Were opened on that day;
With rushing mighty wind and flame, 
The promised Holy Spirit came.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Their loosened tongues were filled 
With strange and wondrous words;
Heaven's life their hearts had thrilled, 
God's goodness they declared;
"And unto all, " th' Apostle said, 
"Is the like gift, since Christ has bled."
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Come now, ye sons of men, 
This message now receive, 
The Holy Spirit's given
To all who will believe;
Ye, too, may know His mighty power, 
And speak with tongues this very hour.
</p><p class="stanza">
5. Then charity divine, 
Your yearning hearts shall fill
T'wards those who now repine, 
Held in sin's bondage still;
For these your zeal shall never tire
To snatch them from th' e'erlasting fire.
