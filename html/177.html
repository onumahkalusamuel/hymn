1. Search me, O God, and know my heart today,
Try me, O Lord, and  know my thoughts, I pray;
See if there be some wicked way in me;
Cleanse me from ev'ry sin, and set me free.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. I praise Thee, Lord, for cleansing me from sin;
Fulfil Thy word and make me pure within;
Fill me with fire, where once I burned with shame;
Grant my desire to magnify Thy name.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Lord, take my life, and make it wholly Thine;
Fill my poor heart with Thy great love divine;
Take all my will, my passion, self and pride;
I now surrender - Lord, in me abide.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. O Holy Ghost, revival comes from Thee;
Send a revival - start the work in me:
Thy Word declares Thou wilt supply our need;
For blessings now, O Lord, I humbly plead.
