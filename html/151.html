1. "There shall be showers of blessing:"
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
Sent from the Saviour above.

Showers of blessing,
Showers of blessing we need:
Mercy drops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.

2. "There shall be showers of blessing:"
Precious reviving again;
Over the hills and the valleys,
Sound of abundance of rain.
</p><p class="chorus">
Showers of blessing,
Showers of blessing we need:
Mercy drops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.
</p><p class="stanza">
3.	"There shall be showers of blessing;"
Send them upon us, O Lord;
Grant to us now a refreshing,
Come, and now honour Thy Word.
</p><p class="chorus">
Showers of blessing,
Showers of blessing we need:
Mercy drops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.

4. There shall be showers of blessing:
Oh, that today they might fall,
Now as to God we're confessing,
Now as on Jesus we call!
</p><p class="chorus">
Showers of blessing,
Showers of blessing we need:
Mercy drops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.
</p><p class="stanza">
5. There shall be showers of blessing,
If we but trust and obey;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
If we let God have His way.
</p><p class="chorus">
Showers of blessing,
Showers of blessing we need:
Mercy drops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.
