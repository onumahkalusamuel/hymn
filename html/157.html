1. Have you wandered away from your Father's care,
Heavy-hearted and sad do you roam?
There's a sweet gentle voice calling now to you - 
Wand'ring child, wand'ring child, O, come home.
  </p><p class="chorus">
Child, come home, child, come home,
Wand'ring child, why longer roam?
'Tis thy Father entreats,
Wand'ring child, O, come home.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Is your frail bark adrift on life's raging sea, 
Are you tossed on its billows and foam?
There's a safe harbour home, waiting now for you - 
Wand'ring child, wand'ring child, O, come home.
 </p><p class="chorus">
Child, come home, child, come home,
Wand'ring child, why longer roam?
'Tis thy Father entreats,
Wand'ring child, O, come home.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. He is pleading today, heed His gentle voice,
As he bids you no longer to roam,
To that dear Father's house haste without delay -
Wand'ring child, wand'ring child, O, come home.
  </p><p class="chorus">
Child, come home, child, come home,
Wand'ring child, why longer roam?
'Tis thy Father entreats,
Wand'ring child, O, come home.
