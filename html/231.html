Send the light!...  Send the light!
There are souls to rescue, there are souls to save,
Send the light!...  Send the light!...

Let it shine... from shore to shore!...
Send the light!... and let its radiance beams,
Light the world... forevermore....

Send the light!...  Send the light!
And a golden off'ring at the cross we lay,
Send the light!...  Send the light!...

Send the light!...  Send the light!
And a Christ-like spirit everywhere be found,
Send the light!  Send the light!...

Send the light!...  Send the light!
Let us gather jewels for a crown above,
Send the light!...  Send the light!....
