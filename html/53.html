1. So send I you - to labour unrewarded
To serve unpaid, unloved, unsought, unknown
To bear rebuke, to suffer scorn and scoffing
So send I you - to toil for Me alone
</p><p class="chorus">
"As the Father hath sent Me,
so send I you."
</p><p class="stanza">
2. So send I you - to bind the bruised and broken
O'er wandering souls to work, to weep, to wake
To bear the burdens of a world a-weary
So send I you - to suffer for My sake
</p><p class="chorus">
"As the Father hath sent Me,
so send I you."
</p><p class="stanza">
3. So send I you - to loneliness and longing
With heart a-hungering for the loved and known
Forsaking home and kindred, friend and dear one
So send I you - to know My love alone
</p><p class="chorus">
"As the Father hath sent Me,
so send I you."
</p><p class="stanza">
4. So send I you - to leave your life's ambition
To die to dear desire, self-will resign
To labour long and love where men revile you
So send I you - to lose your life in Mine
</p><p class="chorus">
"As the Father hath sent Me,
so send I you."
</p><p class="stanza">
5. So send I you - to hearts made hard by hatred
To eyes made blind because they will not see
To spend, tho' it be blood to spend and spare not
So send I you - to taste of Calvary 
</p><p class="chorus">
"As the Father hath sent Me,
so send I you."
