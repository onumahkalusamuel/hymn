1. Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
Oh, what a fore-taste of glory divine!
Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
Born of His Spirit, wash'd in His blood.       
</p><p class="chorus">
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Saviour all the day long;
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Saviour all	the day long.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight,
Angels descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.
</p><p class="chorus">
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Saviour all the day long;
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Saviour all	the day long.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Perfect submission, all is at rest,
I in my Saviour am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Fill'd with His goodness, lost in His love.
</p><p class="chorus">
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Saviour all the day long;
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Saviour all	the day long.
