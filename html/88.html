1. "Take up thy cross and follow Me,"
I heard my Master say;
"I gave My life to ransom thee, 
Surrender your all today."
</p><p class="chorus">
Wherever He leads I'll go,
Wherever He leads I'll go,
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so,
Wherever He leads I'll go.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. He drew me closer to His side, 
I sought His will to know,
And in that will I now abide, 
Wherever He leads I'll go.
</p><p class="chorus">
Wherever He leads I'll go,
Wherever He leads I'll go,
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so,
Wherever He leads I'll go.
</p><p class="stanza">
3.	It may be thro' the shadows dim, 
Or o'er the stormy sea,
I take my cross and follow Him, 
Wherever He leadeth me.
</p><p class="chorus">
Wherever He leads I'll go,
Wherever He leads I'll go,
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so,
Wherever He leads I'll go.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. My heart, my life, my all I bring 
To Christ who loves me so;
He is my Master, Lord, and King, 
Wherever He leads I'll go.
</p><p class="chorus">
Wherever He leads I'll go,
Wherever He leads I'll go,
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so,
Wherever He leads I'll go.
