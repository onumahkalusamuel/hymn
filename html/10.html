1. O for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer's praise,
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace!
</p><p class="stanza">
2. My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honours of Thy name.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Jesus! The name that charms our fears.
That bids our sorrows cease;
'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
'Tis life, and health, and peace.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean,
His blood availed for me.
</p><p class="stanza">
5. Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Saviour come,
And leap, ye lame, for joy!
