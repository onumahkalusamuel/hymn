1. Ere you left your room this morning,
Did you think to pray?
In the name of Christ our Saviour,
Did you sue for loving favour,
As a shield today?
 </p><p class="chorus">
O how praying rests the weary!
Prayer will change the night to day;
So when life seems dark and dreary,
Don't forget to pray.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. When you met with great temptation,
Did you think to pray?
By His dying love and merit,
Did you claim the Holy Spirit
As your guide and stay?
 </p><p class="chorus">
O how praying rests the weary!
Prayer will change the night to day;
So when life seems dark and dreary,
Don't forget to pray.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. When your heart was filled with overburdened,
Did you think to pray?
Did you plead for grace, my brother,
That you might forgive another
Who had crossed your way?
 </p><p class="chorus">
O how praying rests the weary!
Prayer will change the night to day;
So when life seems dark and dreary,
Don't forget to pray.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. When sore trials came upon you,
Did you think to pray?
When your soul was bowed in sorrow,
Balm of Gilead did you borrow
At the gates  today?
 </p><p class="chorus">
O how praying rests the weary!
Prayer will change the night to day;
So when life seems dark and dreary,
Don't forget to pray.
