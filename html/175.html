1. Lift up your heads pilgrims aweary,
See day's approach now crimson the sky;
Night shadows flee, and your Beloved,
Awaited with longing at last draweth nigh.
 </p><p class="chorus">
He is coming again, He is coming again,
The very same Jesus, rejected of men;
He is coming again, He is coming again,
With pow'r and great glory,
He is coming again!
</p><p class="stanza">
2.	Dark was the night, sin warred against us;
Heavy the load of sorrow we bore;
But now we see signs of His coming; -
Our hearts glow within us joy's cup runneth o'er!
 </p><p class="chorus">
He is coming again, He is coming again,
The very same Jesus, rejected of men;
He is coming again, He is coming again,
With pow'r and great glory,
He is coming again!
</p><p class="stanza">
3. O blessed hope!  O blissful promise!
Filling our hearts with rapture divine;
O day of days!  Hail Thy appearing!
Thy transcendent glory forever shall shine!
  </p><p class="chorus">
He is coming again, He is coming again,
The very same Jesus, rejected of men;
He is coming again, He is coming again,
With pow'r and great glory,
He is coming again!
</p><p class="stanza">
4. Even so, come precious Lord Jesus;
Creation waits redemption to see;
Caught up in clouds, soon we shall meet Thee;
O blessed assurance forever with Thee! 
 </p><p class="chorus">
He is coming again, He is coming again,
The very same Jesus, rejected of men;
He is coming again, He is coming again,
With pow'r and great glory,
He is coming again!
