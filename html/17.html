Nothing but the blood of Jesus,
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
For my pardon this my plea, -
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Nothing but the blood of Jesus:
Nought of good that I have done,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Nothing but the blood of Jesus:
Now by this I'll reach my home:
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
