1. We read of a beautiful heaven,
Prepared for the pure and the free;
These truths in God's Word He has given,
How beautiful heaven must be.
 </p><p class="chorus">
How beautiful heaven must be,
Sweet home of the happy and free;
Fair heaven of rest for the weary,
How beautiful heaven must be.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. In heaven no drooping nor pining,
No wishing for elsewhere to be;
God's light is forever there shining,
How beautiful heaven must be.
</p><p class="chorus">
How beautiful heaven must be,
Sweet home of the happy and free;
Fair heaven of rest for the weary,
How beautiful heaven must be.

3. I'm longing to go to fair heaven,
To be with the happy and free;
To spend the long ages in singing, 
How beautiful heaven must be.
</p><p class="chorus">
How beautiful heaven must be,
Sweet home of the happy and free;
Fair heaven of rest for the weary,
How beautiful heaven must be.
</p><p class="stanza">
4. The angels so sweetly are singing,
Up there by the beautiful sea;
Sweet chords from their gold harps are ringing,
How beautiful heaven must be.
</p><p class="chorus">
How beautiful heaven must be,
Sweet home of the happy and free;
Fair heaven of rest for the weary,
How beautiful heaven must be.
