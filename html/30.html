1. Upon life's boundless ocean where mighty billows roll,
I've fixed my hope in Jesus, blest anchor of my soul;
When trials fierce assail me as storms are gathering o'er,
I rest upon His mercy and trust Him more.
</p><p class="chorus">
I've anchored in Jesus,
the storms of life I'll brave,
I've anchored in Jesus,
I fear no wind or wave;
I've anchored in Jesus,
for He hath pow'r to save,
I've anchored to the Rock of Ages.
</p><p class="stanza">
2. He keeps my soul from evil and gives me blessed peace,
His voice hath stilled the waters and bid their tumult cease;
My Pilot and Deliverer, to Him I all confide,
For always when I need Him, He's at my side.
</p><p class="chorus">
I've anchored in Jesus,
the storms of life I'll brave,
I've anchored in Jesus,
I fear no wind or wave;
I've anchored in Jesus,
for He hath pow'r to save,
I've anchored to the Rock of Ages.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. He is my Friend and Saviour, in Him my anchor's cast,
He drives away my sorrows and shields me from the blast;
By faith I'm looking upward beyond life's troubled sea,
There I behold a haven prepared for me.
</p><p class="chorus">
I've anchored in Jesus,
the storms of life I'll brave,
I've anchored in Jesus,
I fear no wind or wave;
I've anchored in Jesus,
for He hath pow'r to save,
I've anchored to the Rock of Ages.
