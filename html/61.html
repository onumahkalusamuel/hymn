1. Lord, speak to me that I may speak
In living echoes of Thy tone;
As Thou hast sought, so let me seek
Thy erring children lost and lone.
</p><p class="stanza">
2.	Oh, lead me, Lord, that I may lead
The wandering and the wavering feet;
O feed me, Lord, that I may feed
Thy hungering ones with manna sweet.
</p><p class="stanza">
3. Oh, strengthen me, that while I stand
Firm on the Rock; and strong in Thee,
I may stretch out a loving hand
To wrestlers with the troubled sea.
</p><p class="stanza">
4.	Oh teach me, Lord, that I may teach
The precious things Thou dost impart;
And wing my words, that they may reach
The hidden depths of many a heart.
</p><p class="stanza">
5.	Oh, give Thine own sweet rest to me,
That I may speak with soothing power
A word in season, as from Thee,
To weary ones in needful hour.
</p><p class="stanza">
6.	Oh, fill me with Thy fullness, Lord,
Until my very heart o'erflow
In kindling thought and glowing word,
Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show.
</p><p class="stanza">
7.	Oh, use me, Lord, use even me,
Just as Thou wilt, and how, and where;
Until Thy blessed face I see,
Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share.
